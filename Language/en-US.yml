Despite its rather large size, it appears to be relatively fast and in its spare time likes to perch on random things in the interrogation chamber. It doesn't react too well to our staff when approached, as the creature will puff up its feathers in a bid to appear larger.

By the way Commander, I just heard that they would like to put your face on a new money bill, meant to represent an 'anonymous citizen of the country'!"
  STR_HYBRID_SCIENTIST_UFOPEDIA: "Hybrid scientists supervise human research and conduct experiments in biology, genetics and metapsychology. Their sharp intellect exceeds that of other hybrids, but their combat skills are mediocre. Capturing scientists alive should be a priority, as they often have extensive knowledge of alien research activities."
  STR_ADVENT: "ADVENT"
  STR_ADVENT_UFOPEDIA: "ADVENT is a fanatical union of various alien agents and allied forces, whose activities focus on supporting alien infiltration missions. Lead by the aliens, this organization aims to subordinate Earth states through creation of puppet regimes. At the initial stage, ADVENT develops a spy network in the country, introducing its agents into all sectors of society, including officials, members of the government, and high-ranking military personnel. An important step is signing a secret cooperation pact between the state and the newcomers, resulting in withdrawal from the Council of Funding Nations.{NEWLINE}ADVENT can then act more openly, forming a variety of government entities that, among other activities, can effectively cover up secret alien operations. Some people volunteer to help them, led astray by the promises of a brighter future and an age of peace the aliens will bring. But the truth about the real plans of the aliens will not be revealed to the masses until they take control over the entire planet."
  STR_DISGUISED_HYBRID_AUTOPSY: "Disguised Hybrid Autopsy"
  STR_DISGUISED_HYBRID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature looks like a human from the outside. The skin and muscular tissues are perfectly human, but internal organ structure and the skeleton are markedly different. The brain is extremely developed, except for the cerebellum. It seems that the brain was 'compressed' with strange internal muscles to fit inside a human-sized skull. Within a few days, the creature's skin began to deteriorate significantly, exposing gray hide and black eyes."

  STR_ALIEN_NEURAL_NETWORK_UFOPEDIA: "Despite most of the alien species being sapient, their society has many features of a collective mind. Each individual's consciousness is connected to some kind of psionic network, allowing them to exchange thoughts and amass their mental potential. The nodes of this network are creatures known to us as 'alien brains'. Each alien brain connects the minds of all subordinates over a certain area, working as a sort of command center leading alien operations. Nonetheless, this being does not have a discernible individual will, but acts within the collective mind. The psionic network has a vertical structure, where younger 'brains' are within the sphere of influence of older beings. Consequently, the entire network must have a single center."
  STR_ALIEN_BRAIN_CORPSE: "Alien Brain Remains"

  STR_ALIEN_BRAIN_REMAINS_UFOPEDIA: "Analysis of tissue samples from this strange creature found in the alien base allows us to conclude that it has penetrated almost the entire complex with its branching appendages. It almost entirely consists of cells similar to neurons, and has no distinct internal organs, being connected to a complex life support system. The center of its body consists of a ball covered with rough skin and having several eyes of different sizes, held in the air by an anti-gravity mechanism. Apparently this alien 'brain' was a kind of strategic computer, and its branches allowed it to produce the very powerful psionic emission to control subordinates at a great distance."

Genetic analysis showed that living cells came from a number of humans, about 15 people per container. It is noteworthy that each section of the container holds material from people of the same sex.{NEWLINE}Analysis of the stem cells' structure suggests that they were somehow transformed from a wide variety of muscle, organ and bone tissues. Judging by the volume of the biomaterial, the donors have been almost completely refined.{NEWLINE}As terrible as it may be, these people are now gone, while this material is invaluable for advanced cell research and will be in great demand from any relevant research centers.

Across the internal surface there are spray nozzles connected to tanks holding a luminous liquid. Microbiological analysis of the fluid confirmed the presence of human DNA, as well as a great number of stem cells with unusual genomic properties.{NEWLINE}The device is equipped with a complex computing circuit, which is connected to the millimeter-wave emitters.

The muscles of the specimen are not fully formed. Despite the adult appearance, there are no signs of aging in the tissues. The specimen is not fit for survival; within a few hours after removal from tank, weak brain activity manifested, similar in pattern to embryonic development but significantly more active. 4 hours after the extraction, the specimen fell into a coma and an hour later, death was confirmed.{NEWLINE}DNA analysis cross-referenced with our database established that the specimen is an exact genetic copy of a prominent politician from the radical opposition who disappeared under unknown circumstances several months ago."

Under the guise of a private clinic, offering innovative treatment of serious illnesses, such as cancer, AIDS, and hereditary diseases, Hybrids conducted extensive genetic studies and categorization of the population. Their advanced methods and attractive payment models attracted people from all walks of life.{NEWLINE}According to logic that is not fully understood by us, surgery is offered to selected patients, and after applying strong anesthetics, the patient is placed in stasis and transferred to another, unknown location.{NEWLINE}Genetic treatment of those who aren't abducted has a short-term effect that will force them to repeat the treatment. Apparently, this will have serious mutagenic effects on patients' offspring."

  STR_ALIEN_KEY_UFOPEDIA: "This glowing object emits powerful signals with variable frequency. Every 25 hours, the pulse signature changes. The transmitter's power source is perplexing, and the complex nature of the signal suggests that the item is a wireless key or a beacon."
  STR_CLONING_INF_PLOT: "Aliens Plot - Clones"
  STR_CLONING_INF_PLOT_UFOPEDIA: "We managed to grasp the alien plans for human cloning. Using a network of medical institutions, Hybrids collect DNA samples of people with significant influence over the society, then abduct the original and create their clone. Candidates who are not burdened with close friendly and family ties are especially hard to detect after being substituted. Meanwhile the original is kept alive in isolation, though we cannot understand the reasons for this.{NEWLINE}The clones are cleverly introduced into human society through an established spy network, and then lead subversive activities against X-Com and the Council, aimed at securing loyalty to the aliens from the government and society at large."
  STR_MC_INF_PLOT: "Aliens Plot - Mind Control"
  STR_MC_INF_PLOT_UFOPEDIA: "We knew that some psionic abilities enable the user to control minds, but it was difficult for us to realize the scale at which the aliens use this technique for infiltration. In order to achieve their goals, the aliens can establish periodic or even permanent mind control over key public figures in the infiltrated country, including heads of state.{NEWLINE}We believe that the alien psionic network has a tree-like structure where the main source can transmit some of its psionic potential to subordinate beings, and those in turn establish control over the target's mind when maintaining close contact with them. A wide network of human clones remotely controlled by the aliens has infiltrated deep into human society. Perhaps this main source of psionic activity is somehow related to the alien embassy."
  STR_HYBRID_INF_PLOT: "Aliens Plot - Hybrids"
  STR_HYBRID_INF_PLOT_UFOPEDIA: "As it turned out, Hybrids play a crucial role in the alien infiltration plan. Usually they are well disguised using their psionic abilities. Such a disguise, however, is often insufficient for deep infiltration by agents and the performance of covert operations.{NEWLINE}In horrible ways, they extract significant amounts of highly responsive biomaterial from hundreds of people, and apply it to an alien Hybrid to create a complete disguise that can't be detected even through close physical contact. The biomaterial merges with the Hybrid's body and any attempts to remove it from a live Hybrid would lead to its painful death.{NEWLINE}The disguise begins to slowly degrade over the course of several weeks and so the Hybrid agent needs to renew it periodically. For this purpose, a well-established and concealed network of clinics is used for kidnapping people and transporting them to processing centers. There, the biomaterial is extracted and distributed to safe points, which are used by Hybrid agents to renew their disguises."
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_DETAILS: "Alien Infiltration Methods"
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_DETAILS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien hybrids carry out numerous secret operations using the disguise they have developed, which uses kidnapped people as raw materials. These agents, acting over the years, hold important leadership positions and are able to influence policy and effectively cover up other operations. Alien agents replace people with psionic-controlled clones that can become the transmitters of the alien psionic network, allowing them to control the minds of nearby targets, including well-protected VIPs.{NEWLINE}Now we are sure that the source of psionic activity is in a hidden underground site located under the alien embassy. Most likely, ground operations in the region are coordinated from there as well. By securing this location we will severely disrupt much of the alien effort. We will disconnect the clones from the alien control and then they will be easily identified, as they are not capable of independent higher nervous activity. The aliens will lose control over people's minds and Hybrid agents will become too disorganized to properly maintain their disguise."
  STR_ALIEN_KEY_DECRYPTION: "Alien Key Decryption"
  STR_ALIEN_KEY_DECRYPTION_UFOPEDIA: "We were able to decode the signals emitted by the Alien Key and develop the technology to calibrate the response message. The Key interacts with a security mechanism of the alien base located under the embassy, resonating at coherent frequencies if it is located within a 50 km range. Key sequences change continuously and are synchronized by combining hyperwave coupling with psionic surge.{NEWLINE}We can produce a device that replicates the mechanism of emission synchronization, which will allow our forces to infiltrate the underground complex."

It is a proof of success of the alien infiltration; their embassy in the controlled country. From here, ADVENT agents' activities are regulated according to the recently signed secret pact of cooperation between the state and the interplanetary invasion forces. The embassy is well guarded, and a direct attack on it without a well-designed plan will not effectively reverse the effects of alien infiltration; we would be labeled terrorists and it will only exacerbate the situation.{NEWLINE}According to interrogated alien agents, the embassy has a secret entrance to a large underground complex, which is the command center for all operations in the region. Apparently, the entrance to the complex has some kind of security mechanism against unauthorized entry. We need to understand the principle of this defense before we prepare an assault schedule."
  STR_ALIEN_EMBASSY_DESCRIPTION: "There is significant UFO activity in this area. We associate this activity with the recent government complex.

Prospective weapons are characterized by significant damage inflicted by a high-energy impulse within the surrounding environment. This reduces effectiveness of the target's armor, as well as allows effective use at the atmospheric pressure as well as underwater at any depth. Unfortunately, we have not yet succeeded in achieving a sufficient focusing of the emitted pulse, therefore with a distance the charge energy inevitably decreases.

Unfortunately we cannot simply go behind their backs and copy the data from their computer due to the nature of the software and its tight binding to the architecture of the computing core.{NEWLINE}I propose to refuse this data transfer and complete the weapons ourselves.

  STR_MILITARY_COMPUTER_UFOPEDIA: "By reverse engineering, we succeeded in understanding the basic principle of operation of the military computer we captured. The system restricting access to data has a multi-layer design, which makes hacking difficult. We managed to do it, but due to the fact that each instance has its own characteristics in the security system, an individual approach is needed every time.

  STR_ETHEREAL_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereals come from a world where telepathic bonds are prevalent and many species form collective minds. They also lived in such groups at first, but as their culture developed, they learned how to cut themselves off the collective and attain individuality. This helped advance their society further, but also made them suffer, since they were poorly adapted to loneliness. Finally two competing ideologies emerged: either to promote individuality as a noble cause (and become martyrs), or go back to the blissful hivemind state. But they found a compromise: they would designate certain individuals to become the elites and the rest will be reduced to servants. The elites would not mind-meld with one another, only with the 'plebs', who would be made stupid and mentally weak to prevent from gaining any control over the network. These 'plebs' are known to us as Mutons. Every elite member is an individual (as each would reign over their personal psi network), but also not suffer from separation (as the Mutons would be their family now).

  STR_DREAMING: "Dreaming"
  STR_DREAMING_UFOPEDIA: "Dreaming is a mental technique which allows the practitioner to enter a meditative trance to explore their own mind. While the details of how it works remain unclear, it seems to connect the brain to some external medium dubbed 'Dreamscape', allowing full manifestation of the subject inside their own dream. This is a dangerous process, since the dreamer is exposed to various natural forces governing the Dreamscape, meaning that any damage taken in the dream causes mental deterioration and possibly death.{NEWLINE}Dreaming is a solitary mission, since one cannot take others with them to their own dreams. Naturally, the same applies to physical items: you cannot take anything with you, or bring anything back.

  STR_THE_PHANTOM_MENACE_UFOPEDIA: "Up until now we referred to the alien menace as 'invasion', but perhaps we were in the wrong. Secret deals, terrorist attacks, dissemination of tech - these are not the tools of conquest. Maybe the aliens disapprove of the concept of war, maybe they just don't understand it, or maybe they simply do not have the means to attack the Earth openly? Or maybe they want it intact for their unfathomable plans? Whatever the case, we should not think of the alien forces as an army; otherwise we'd probably all be knee deep in corpses by now.

  STR_DAVID_VINCENT_INTERROGATION_UFOPEDIA: "The scientist we saved, David Vincent, told us over a cup of soothing tea about the results of his research. He began his work in the 1960s: after he witnessed a UFO landing near Los Angeles, he started gathering evidence of their presence on Earth. His activity has not gone unnoticed by the aliens and he had to leave his former life, hiding in a remote area. There he continued his work despite the risk.

  STR_CALCINITE: "Calcinite"
  STR_CALCINITE_UFOPEDIA: "Like the diving suits of lost mariners these aliens stalk the seabed for the unwary. Swirling around in the face mask a gelatinous green form can be seen. The blob is held together with a potent bioelectric field, which can also be extended beyond the body and used for attacks."
  STR_CALCINITE_AUTOPSY: "Calcinite Autopsy"
  STR_CALCINITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once the armored suit is stripped away, the Calcinite is revealed to be a huge amorphous blob of protoplasm. No visible brain, limbs or sensory organs exist. A small metallic component resides deep in the liquid body. Once dead we can only guess at the creature's nature. An inexplicable enigma of our alien enemies."

It periodically emits strange particles of unknown nature of function."
  REGION_HELLO_WORLD: "The World"
  STR_COUNCIL_POWER_CHAIN: "Council's Power Chain"
  STR_COUNCIL_POWER_CHAIN_UFOPEDIA: "There are two main categories of organizations serving the Council. The first category are referred to as 'technical' and covers global administration; for example, the World Bank. These organizations are expected to do their thing efficiently to ensure that the global order is maintained. Their affairs are generally not discussed during Council sessions, they are only monitored for results. Each of them is supervised by a High Commissar (a member of their inner circle of the Council but not one of the actual deciders) and audited by other High Commissars. The other category is often called 'political'. These organizations, while often smaller than some 'technicals', are considered to be a part of political struggle. Such entities are harming certain big factions while others profit from them, so they are viciously contested and fought over. As you probably guessed, we are in the second category: promoted by some part of the Council, but to the detriment of some other factions. This is why we have so many enemies and stupid obstacles; but also this is why we enjoy so much leeway in our mistakes."

  STR_COVER_WORKERS_UFOPEDIA: "Industrial facilities are a popular low-level target for enemy infiltrations. Now we are able to perform counter-infiltrations right under the nose of the enemy by dressing our agents in worker clothes."
  STR_COVER_SPORTSMEN: "Cover: Sportsmen"
  STR_COVER_SPORTSMEN_UFOPEDIA: "It is sometimes crucial to infiltrate a country quietly, to avoid a diplomatic incident. X-Com agents can pose as sportsmen going for a training camp. This will however restrict their equipment to items that are appropriate for their cover. It will also allow X-Com to buy and use Sporting Rifles on missions."
  STR_COVER_SURFERS: "Cover: Surfers"
  STR_COVER_SURFERS_UFOPEDIA: "Tourist resorts can be a surprisingly common area of operations for criminals. With this cover, X-Com agents can respond to situations where going around in a suit would attract too much attention. This also covers basic surfing training for the entire staff."
  STR_COVER_SCIENTISTS: "Cover: Scientists"
  STR_COVER_SCIENTISTS_UFOPEDIA: "We have progressed to a more serious game: infiltrating elite research and medical facilities. Their personnel is rife with shady characters to investigate.

  STR_SNIPER_SPOTTER_COOPERATION: "Sniper/Spotter Cooperation"
  STR_SNIPER_SPOTTER_COOPERATION_UFOPEDIA: "Our foes often rely on communication to put pressure on X-Com agents in combat. Many enemies have either a 'Spotter' ability or a 'Sniper' ability, or both. 'Spotters' can rely information on any X-Com units they can see to 'Snipers', who in turn can target them even if they do not see them directly. Such attacks suffer -50% accuracy penalty, like all shots directed at unseen targets."
  STR_FIRE_SPRAYING: "Fire Spraying"
  STR_FIRE_SPRAYING_UFOPEDIA: "Many automatic weapons allow to saturate a whole area between two given points. Hold CTRL+SHIFT while clicking auto shot to 'spray and pray' when it's enabled.

  STR_ZOMBIES_AT_PEACE_UFOPEDIA: "With Pharaoh's downfall, the Ancient Ones were able to approach the Newborns diplomatically. A truce was made, followed by negotiations and finally an agreement to join forces. Everyone would profit from the treaty: the Newborns were invited to join as equals an orderly society with a rich culture, while the Ancient Ones were invigorated with the new blood. It was beneficial to X-Com as well: the end of the war meant more control over any leftover Zombies on the surface, as any remnants were to be tracked down by the Coven and taken underground to become their servants."
  STR_REPTOIDS_IN_THE_SHADOWS_UFOPEDIA: "But even this day of triumph is tainted by the terrible knowledge: deep down below, Reptoids are still challenging all other sentient lifeforms on Earth. Never resting, always watching, incessantly scheming, they are never far enough to relax. Today we celebrate, but tomorrow we must double our efforts to defend our planet."

It possesses low intelligence, but its sheer weight combined with deadly reflexes makes it a formidable predator."
  STR_BULLFROG_AUTOPSY: "Bullfrog Autopsy"
  STR_BULLFROG_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This large frog-like specimen appears to be either a species yet unknown to science or an artificially created organism. Unlike what we know about large ancient amphibians, this creature shows signs of fast metabolism, which explains how it can survive and thrive in a terrestrial environment.

  STR_MINOTAUR_UFOPEDIA: "This hulking monstrosity is the perfect mix of human and bovine features that together create an unstoppable warrior. Its intelligence is very limited and does not even allow it to speak, but it can execute simple battle commands and even assess tactical situations. It is rather docile most of the time and can be used as an unsupervised guard, but in combat it instantly becomes enraged and will attack any foe in sight with extreme prejudice."

  STR_BUG_EYE_GHOST: "Bug Eye Ghost"
  STR_BUG_EYE_GHOST_UFOPEDIA: "This malicious apparition is in fact a psionic energy node, manifesting as a 'creature'. It is mostly made of energy and ignores most environmental hazards, except violent energy discharges and psi attacks. It is mindless, but perceives human minds and hunts for their psi energy, which is unpleasant to the victim and may even be fatal. To quote the classics, it's life, but not as we know it."
  STR_SKULL_WRAITH_ARMOR: "Spectral Entity Combat Analysis"
  STR_SKULL_WRAITH: "Spectral Entity"
  STR_SKULL_WRAITH_UFOPEDIA: "This aggregation of psionic energy is especially powerful. It feeds on negative human emotions, converting psionic energy into ectoplasm. Its hunting strategy is to induce fear in victims and drain them of mental energy as they are paralyzed with terror. It only responds reliably to violent energy bursts and psi."
  STR_ECTOPLASM: "Ectoplasm"
  STR_ECTOPLASM_UFOPEDIA: "This mysterious substance is undoubtedly normal matter, but its chemical, quasi-organic composition is chaotic and hard to explain. Moreover, it is charged with residual mental energy. It decays quickly and requires a special facility for further studies."

  STR_HYBRID_CONTROL_CIRCUITRY: "Hybrid Control Circuitry"
  STR_HYBRID_CONTROL_CIRCUITRY_UFOPEDIA: "This incredibly complex piece of machinery is like a telephone exchange, but for psionics. It stores data of all existing hybrids, including their unique psionic imprints, and helps direct a psionic message towards that particular agent. By sending emotion waves, the device communicates to the hybrids whether their masters are pleased with them or not. It also has built-in 'software' for recognizing patterns that indicate a hybrid may revolt and go rogue. This device was meant for absolute oppression, but now we can use it for good: to easily find hybrids who would be willing to betray their creators."

  STR_DREAMERS: "Dreamers"
  STR_DREAMERS_UFOPEDIA: "Apparently the ancient psions developed a technique called 'deep dreaming', which allowed them to enter a dream state they used for meditation and even communication with one another. This skill still survives in some Immortals, but even among them it has become rare. To compare ourselves to our predecessors is a humbling experience!"
  STR_ANEXIS_OFFER: "Anexi's Offer"
  STR_ANEXIS_OFFER_UFOPEDIA: "I am Anexi of the House of Burning Heavens, Sister of the Snake Prophet. I thank you for intervening on our behalf and defeating the Newborn army. We have lived in these caverns for millennia, but these Newborns are trying to claim our sacred grounds. They are young and stupid, but numerous. They are no match for our minds, but we are few, and the front line is long. I welcome your company, as you have many able servants. Would you be interested in a... discreet alliance?"
  STR_THE_NEPHILIM: "The Nephilim"
  STR_THE_NEPHILIM_UFOPEDIA: "In ancient times, aliens also visited the Earth. Like today, they mixed alien DNA with humans, creating hybrids. A notable difference from our case is that the DNA came mostly from Ethereals, not Sectoids. These hybrids were intelligent, psionically gifted and had an unusually long life span. However, they seem to have been abandoned by their alien masters, or perhaps they rebelled; in any case, they went to live with ancient humans and often became their leaders. They might even be the source of human psi potential. We don't know what happened to them, but there is a possibility they are still around, pulling the strings from the shadows. Who knows?"
  STR_PHASE_DRIVE: "Phase Drive"
  STR_PHASE_DRIVE_UFOPEDIA: "This incredibly advanced device allows a craft to 'phase out' of our reality, which enables it to go through solid matter with no harm to the ship or the environment. It is used by Reptoids mainly to travel between their underground settlements and the surface of Earth, but it also gives their vehicles defensive abilities, as it can 'blink' in and out of existence to avoid oncoming missiles. Its downside is that a phased craft has no means to observe the outside world, except for psi powers."

With their aid we have started a new company: Hydrospace Dynamics. This company will be handling the construction of all our deep-sea submersibles and equipment that we lack the capacity for and their first project is already complete! This new submersible, the Barracuda, was created using our knowledge of USO construction principles and sonic weaponry. Together this will allow them to engage the elusive supply cruisers of T'leth and force them to land.

  STR_ARROW_INVESTIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "After we started looking around for new data on the CF-105, we were contacted by a member of the Council, Mr. Mihko Mayestewan. He claimed to act as a private person, not a Council representative, and provided us with documentation which led us to a semi-abandoned base near Yellowknife. There we found what we assume to be the last Arrow in existence. It requires some renovation, but appears to be in working condition. Perhaps we could find some use for this venerable craft? It is a fighter after all!"
  STR_ARROW_RUMORS: "CF-105 Arrow Rumors"
  STR_ARROW_RUMORS_UFOPEDIA: "We have stumbled upon an interesting piece of history regarding the CF-105 fighter, designed in Canada in the 1950's and widely acclaimed for its revolutionary design. This craft was canceled before going into mass production, and it seems that the reasons for it were somehow related to the secret war we're starting to unravel.

To abort the mission return X-Com operatives to the transport vehicle and click on the 'Abort Mission' icon."
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_FERAL_UFOPEDIA: "With its huge size and six limbs, this is a behemoth of the deep. The Lobsterman turned out to have a simple, barely developed mind. What we thought to be vocalizations in the language of Dagon, were in fact meaningless mimicry of sounds it had heard. This thing cannot actually speak and has little understanding of the surrounding world, but appears to be sapient to a degree. In fact, it's hard to say if it has anything to do with Dagon at all."
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_WEAPON: "Lobsterman Claws"
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_UFOPEDIA: "Despite its hulking stature, this creature possesses a keen, alien intelligence. Its augmented perceptions let it track our movements through the containment walls and its calculating nature makes conventional interrogation difficult. Resorting to the tedious process of extracting data from the cranial implants has been far more fruitful: as far as we can tell, these creatures are living appendages of T'leth itself, directed through the MC network. Ruthlessly efficient, their only discernible emotion is a sort of satisfaction in completing their objectives."
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_FERAL_AUTOPSY: "Feral Lobsterman Autopsy"
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_FERAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is an abomination of genetic engineering that far outstrips anything else we have witnessed. Its shell is nigh-impervious to anything that can't be wedged between the carapace plates, and laughs in the face of firearms. It lacks the implants typically found in many undersea aberrations."
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_AUTOPSY: "Lobsterman Autopsy"
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This monstrosity has been enhanced in dozens of ways, most only visible after its virtually indestructible shell has been cracked open. The eyes have been replaced with multi-band scanners, while the brain is riddled with intelligence-enhancing implants and most of the other organs have been either enhanced or replaced outright by alien technology. Terrifying in power, the only true weakness is a vulnerability to sudden sharp drops or spikes in temperature due to the cold-blooded circulatory system."

  STR_CARCHARODON_FERAL_AUTOPSY: "Feral Carcharodon Autopsy"
  STR_CARCHARODON_FERAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This odd creature, obviously an attempt at blending human DNA with that of a shark, has a hide constructed of a steel-hard biological polymer of aqua-plastic. This specimen has none of the cybernetic enhancements common to Dagon-affiliated organisms."
  STR_CARCHARODON_AUTOPSY: "Carcharodon Autopsy"
  STR_CARCHARODON_FERAL_UFOPEDIA: "This shark-man is less a man, more a beast. If it can talk, it isn't showing it, as it constantly attempts to bite at the walls of its prison instead of responding to our attempts at interrogation."
  STR_CARCHARODON_UFOPEDIA: "These creatures are barely a half-step removed from their feral prototypes. The implants within them seem to only be minimally effective at restraining their natural impulses, resulting in a personality consumed with bloodlust and rage. As a result, they are unable to resist the compulsion to consume their own wounded, meaning that they have no true medics. This lack of restraint also causes them to pass into a berserk state in combat."
  STR_CARCHARODON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is unusually resistant to the cybernetics of T'leth. While the body has over a dozen examples of cybernetic enhancement, the majority of them are only partially functional, especially the MC implants located within the skull. This seems to be due to a side effect of the creature's robust regenerative abilities, leading its flesh to slowly reject the cybernetics. These problems would seem to indicate that this species is a recent development."
  STR_GREMLIN_POD: "Gremlin Pod"
  STR_GREMLIN_POD_UFOPEDIA: "This crystalline pod contains one small humanoid in suspended animation. With some experimenting, we may be able to open the crystal and recover the life form. Let's hope it's not some kind of trap."
  STR_ASSASSIN_CLANS: "Assassin Clans"
  STR_ASSASSIN_CLANS_UFOPEDIA: "Although the Black Lotus sect was destroyed, many prominent members successfully avoided arrest - particularly the Assassins. While many lost their purpose after their goddess was banished, or even took their own lives, some have decided to use their unique skills for personal gain.

  STR_ALIEN_AI_UFOPEDIA: "We can now construct advanced AI units to pilot our Heavy Weapons Platforms from alien electronics components. These new AIs have learning algorithm subroutines that allow them to become better, stronger, and faster through combat, just like our agents, though they start a bit unoptimized compared to the basic AI units.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Manufacturing one of these AIs puts it in a scout drone chassis and sets up a support technician in our living quarters."

Apparently, the only objective of these raids is to familiarize their troops with human targets and the surface environment.{NEWLINE}Horrible as it is, we suspect that such training would be best applied in forces tasked with human population control.

  STR_REPTOID_ASSASSINATION_UFOPEDIA: "When necessary, Reptoid agents get rid of problematic political figures.

  STR_SHOGG_VILLAGE_DESCRIPTION: "We have located a military settlement of non-human sapients living underground. Pawns of darkness, they are hostile to humanity and must be taken care of."
  STR_SECRET_CULTS: "Secret Cults"
  STR_SECRET_CULTS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Our friends in the Council informed us about powerful cults, hiding in shadows around the world. These cults are dangerous criminals with possible ties to other, more powerful entities - perhaps even the aliens. We must stand up to these sects, investigate them, learn about their nature and eventually thwart their plans."
  STR_CYBERDREDNAUGHT_PLANS: "Cyberdreadnaught Plans"
  STR_CYBERWEB_FORTRESS: "Cyberweb Fortress"
  STR_CYBERWEB_FORTRESS_UFOPEDIA: "We have finally found a Cyberweb outpost in Dimension X. This fortified compound is unlikely to be their main base of operations, but it's bound to have some clues about what the Cyberweb is planning.{NEWLINE}Can I go tell the agents to get ready?"
  STR_DIMENSION_X: "Dimension X"
  STR_DIMENSION_X_SURVEY: "Dimension X Survey"
  STR_DIMENSION_X_SURVEY_UFOPEDIA: "Our away team has successfully launched a survey satellite in the exotic dimension. It appears to be a terrestrial planet orbiting a dying M-class star (which appears much older than our Universe). Although the atmosphere is unsuitable for humans, the planet is teeming with carbon-based life. There are also many artificial structures, mostly in disrepair except for one heavily developed region. This alien architecture appears organic."
  STR_CITY_X_SURVEY: "Dimension X: Alien City Survey"
  STR_CITY_X_SURVEY_UFOPEDIA: "Our survey drones were shot down as they approached the alien city. We only received several images of colossal organic structures above the horizon. Scans show that these structures actually are alive, most likely with similar physiology to other local organisms. The city is protected by saucer-shaped flying machines, armed with explosive missiles and beam weapons. We believe this city is primarily a huge production center, though we don't know its purpose.{NEWLINE}With our resources, we cannot hope to outmatch the alien vessels. I'm afraid we will have to leave the city to future explorers."
  STR_LIZARD_TRAP: "Lizard Trap"
  STR_LIZARD_TRAP_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, we have a plan for hijacking a Reptoid ship! At first we planned to hire some Scorpoid bandits to steal one as soon as a Reptoid appeared, but no mercenary band is strong enough to overpower a village. So instead we found a young, ambitious hunter, very popular among his peers and very dissatisfied with his leaders. So I made him an offer: in exchange for a Reptoid ship, we will help him overthrow the elders and seize local power. He agreed!{NEWLINE}Now we wait for the signal. Once our little protege gives the word, we must assist him and his friends in overpowering the village's defenses. With our superior equipment and your flawless tactics, this should be easy!{NEWLINE}Don't you love political games, Commander? We all do, that's why we're fighting in the Shadow War!"
  STR_MASTERS_OF_SHOGG: "Masters of Shogg"
  STR_MASTERS_OF_SHOGG_UFOPEDIA: "We already knew that the various insectoid tribes inhabiting Shogg were in contact with a more technologically advanced civilization. Now we understand that this civilization lives even deeper down, where it is too hot for a human to survive. These mysterious people, known to us as Reptoids, are firmly in charge of the subterranean political life, but rarely interfere directly with their subordinates' lives. They are known to sell tech in exchange for raw materials and labor. They are not exactly popular with the insectoids, but without their machines, life in Shogg would be impossible.{NEWLINE}Due to their political leverage, we cannot expect to succeed diplomatically in Shogg unless we engage these Reptoids directly. According to our captives, they travel in magical vehicles which can phase through solid rock. If it's true, it could be a bit of a problem for us..."
  STR_GOING_DEEPER: "Going Deeper"
  STR_GOING_DEEPER_UFOPEDIA: "Our exploration of Shogg paints a picture of a hot, dark place. It seems to be inhabited by several sapient species. One of them is the Giant Spiders, whose underground activity is much more complex than we gave them credit for. Others are also thought to be arthropods, bizarre as it may be. These species build loosely connected settlements which utilize highly advanced technology for survival and prosperity. These societies are unlikely to have developed such technology on their own, which provokes all kinds of questions.{NEWLINE}Considering the aliens think them dangerous enough to open a special front, it would be in our interest to form diplomatic relation with Shogg. Unfortunately, these races are inherently hostile, so all attempts at contact failed. It was therefore decided we should use deadly force against them to learn more about them and possibly find a diplomatic solution later."
  STR_ALIEN_SUBTERRANEAN_INVASION_PREQ: "Alien Subterranean Invasion Prerequisite"
  STR_ALIEN_SUBTERRANEAN_INVASION: "Alien Subterranean Invasion"
  STR_ALIEN_SUBTERRANEAN_INVASION_UFOPEDIA: "We have confirmed that alien subterranean outposts are indeed intended as military bases to maintain control over major transportation routes. While human civilization knows next to nothing about Shogg, apparently there are other contestants that the aliens are wary about. Would these mysterious people be enemies of the aliens? Would they be our allies, or would they treat us as yet another invading force? We must, pardon my expression, get to the bottom of this."
  STR_ALIEN_SUBTERRANEAN_ACTIVITY: "Alien Subterranean Activity"
  STR_ALIEN_SUBTERRANEAN_ACTIVITY_UFOPEDIA: "An analysis of what we know about the aliens, cross-referenced with our knowledge of Shogg, strongly suggests that the visitors are more interested in the underworld than anyone expected. While they do not seem to focus on this part of our planet too much, they do have specialized forces to be used exclusively for that purpose. The aliens even build outposts in Shogg, probably in order to ensure military and political control over the surrounding area. Considering that humans do not even explore Shogg, this alien military presence is highly intriguing."
  STR_INTO_THE_DARK_PREQ: "Into The Dark Prerequisite"
  STR_INTO_THE_DARK: "Into The Dark"
  STR_INTO_THE_DARK_UFOPEDIA: "The weird artifacts we found in the caves had a profound influence on my mind. I could not stop thinking about what all this meant! Was there another world down there, hidden from us but great and very real? So I had the idea to modify our scanning technology to explore the Earth's crust. The results are terrible and shocking: deep below our deepest mines, there are indeed vast underground passages, extending across vast areas of land, carefully constructed to remain undetectable to our classic measurements. As per certain occult traditions, I propose to refer to this strange land as 'Shogg'. These tunnels and caverns are obviously too complex to map accurately, but we should start exploring them soon. Who knows what terrible secrets they hold?{NEWLINE}We have also used this new knowledge to find and secure some remaining entrances to Shogg. The Council will monitor them from now on, so we should expect no more hidden cave missions."
  STR_SHOGG_BLADE: "Shogg Blade"
  STR_SHOGG_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "This short sword is too heavy for comfortable use by normal humans, but absolutely devastating when wielded by a stronger fighter. Its terramite edge makes it quite effective against armor."

  STR_SHOGG_CUDGEL_UFOPEDIA: "A simple blunt weapon, fashioned from a variety of materials available in Shogg."
  STR_SHOGG_HAMMER: "Shogg Hammer"

  STR_SHOGG_STAFF_UFOPEDIA: "This metallic staff is made of Terramite. With minimal training, it can be used in hand to hand combat with surprisingly good results."
  STR_SHOGG_LANTERN_UFOPEDIA: "This light source is somewhat cumbersome, but the bioluminous component will never run out of power, as long as the ambient temperature doesn't fall below a certain threshold."

  STR_BROKEN_LANTERN: "Broken Shogg Lantern"

  STR_DULLED_PROMETHEUM: "Dulled Prometheum Crystal"
  STR_DULLED_PROMETHEUM_UFOPEDIA: "This massive crystal is certainly artificial. It is hollow, with traces of a highly energetic reaction inside its cavities."
  STR_STRANGE_ALUMINIUM_TABLET: "Strange Aluminum Tablet"
  STR_STRANGE_ALUMINIUM_TABLET_UFOPEDIA: "This mysterious object features an image of a humanoid face. Preliminary dating indicates it's more than ten thousand years old, which clearly rules out the possibility of having been manufactured by humans - or at least any human civilization we know of."

  STR_METAPSYCHOLOGY: "Metapsychology"
  STR_METAPSYCHOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "The forbidden knowledge we have obtained shows the mysterious world of the unknown in a completely new light. 'Psi' is based on subtle manipulation of electromagnetic fields and other energies which can evoke surprisingly strong effects using the butterfly effect principle. Control over this effect requires solving some very complex and very exotic equations, using certain areas of the brain. This process is generally subconscious, but overindulgence may lead to insanity.{NEWLINE}The devices we've captured contain complex circuitry to serve as a kind of prosthetic to the user's brain; therefore, their efficiency depends directly on user's Psi Strength. However, I believe that there is a possibility of using an unaided brain. How to achieve that, we don't know yet.{NEWLINE}We have successfully completed psionic strength evaluation of our agents. Please consult their files for details."

  STR_PARAPSYCHOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "The proof that psionic abilities exist is before our very eyes. Science finally has to accept the existence of magic. Oh, without a doubt, future scientists will find ways to explain the paranormal, to dissect it and put it in the little boxes of their minds. Given a few centuries, that is. The complexity of the human mind yields poorly to the limited human intellect.{NEWLINE}Observations disclose that humans have varied susceptibility to mind attacks. I theorize this depends on what I call the raw spiritual potential. Measuring that potential is our first task. We don't have centuries, so we need a different approach. It is much easier to simply learn to walk than to describe walking by mathematical equations. We will follow the footsteps of mystics. Analogous models. The Tree of Life. Tarot Cards. Hallucinogenic drugs. We don't know yet what will work... and that makes it exciting, doesn't it?"

  STR_OOZE: "Ooze"
  STR_OOZE_UFOPEDIA: "This life form must come from a very exotic environment. It produces strong psi waves which are used to detect prey.

  STR_ZSRR_STORM_TRADE_UFOPEDIA: "In order to fund their operations, Red Dawn distributes a certain chemical product, used for muscle tissue development. This mysterious mixture dubbed 'Storm' is directly related to the otherworldly Red Dawn technology, ridiculously expensive and in most cases completely pointless (or highly harmful). However, there are rare cases of very successful users of Storm who gain superhuman abilities with no ill effects.

It is mostly organic, and the biological component has a lifespan directly related to weapon usage. We do not possess the means to reproduce this weapon in our labs. Armor is effectively irrelevant against warp weapons."
  STR_DISRUPTOR_HEAVY: "Heavy Disruptor"
  STR_DISRUPTOR_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "This heavy warp weapon is mostly an overgrown exotic life form capable of emitting strange rays that bypass all known forms of armor. The creature feeds on itself to replenish expended energy, so its life span shortens whenever the weapon is used. Replicating this weapon is definitely beyond our capabilities. Armor is effectively irrelevant against warp weapons."
  STR_ACID_PISTOL: "Acid Pistol"
  STR_ACID_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "This gas-operated weapon shoots deadly corrosive fluid. From the intakes on the body, air is chambered and pressurized, to be then used to expel the projectile.

  STR_OUTDATED_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "X-Com Agents will often pick up various antiquated weapons from the field. Researching them might allow us to buy them. But why would X-Com use obsolete technology?{NEWLINE}The first reason is red tape, our most tenacious obstacle. The Council is extremely cautious with trusting us with any modern weaponry, but is more lenient toward outdated armaments.{NEWLINE}The second reason is the nature of our enemy. We are at the peak of firearms technology; our weapons are highly specialized at fighting any known target.

There are also significant behavioral differences: while common Floaters are brutal and violent, this one is calm and collected, yet far outperforms its 'lesser' brethren in military action. This is in no small part an effect of special brain implants, which suppress its raw emotions almost completely and optimize its behavior for maximum efficiency. It is unclear why this horrifying technology isn't used more commonly by the aliens, but a likely reason is decreased long-term mental stability."
  STR_FLOATER_LEGIONNAIRE_AUTOPSY: "Floater Legionnaire Autopsy"
  STR_FLOATER_LEGIONNAIRE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Floater is a huge upgrade over the regular type. All cybernetic implants are more advanced, including the antigravity unit which is stronger and more stable. The Legionnaire has been fitted with very complex cybersenses, giving it perfect battle awareness no matter the conditions, and artificial glands which increase its reflexes. It also wears thick armor, resistant to both standard and energy weapons."
  STR_FLOATER_SOLDIER_ARMOR: "Floater Combat Analysis"
  STR_UNARMED_FLOATER: "Unarmed Floater Attack"
  STR_FLOATER_UFOPEDIA: "The Floaters are primarily soldiers and terror agents. They are naturally predatory beasts, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced to make formidable warriors. The lower half of the body and most internal organs are surgically removed, and a life support system is installed. This implant contains an anti-gravity unit which enables the creature to float, albeit unsteadily, through the air."
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY: "Floater Autopsy"
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The creature has been drastically altered by surgery. The device which seems to form the core of the body is a life support system, taking over the function of heart, lungs and digestive system. This would enable the creature to survive in extremely hostile environments. The brain is smaller than ours, but the sensory organs are well developed."

  STR_CHRYSSALID_UFOPEDIA: "The crab-like claws of this creature are a powerful weapon in close combat. The high metabolism and strength of this creature give it speed and dexterity. Instead of killing its victim it impregnates it with an egg and injects a venom which turns it into a walking zombie. A new Chryssalid will burst from the victim shortly after impregnation. Chryssalids are associated with the Snakeman race."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY: "Chryssalid Autopsy"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The exoskeleton of this creature is extremely tough, but surprisingly vulnerable to explosive ammunition.

  STR_CHRYSSALID_WEAPON: "Chryssalid Claws"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "The Chryssalid uses its powerful pincers to hold the victim in place. This attack is inevitably followed with the infamous proboscis, causing instant 'zombification' of the target."

  STR_BADASS_CHRYSSALID_UFOPEDIA: "This large specimen contains material from several different Chryssalids, who seem to have fused into one, bigger organism.

  STR_BADASS_CHRYSSALID_WEAPON: "Ultra Chryssalid Claws"
  STR_BADASS_CHRYSSALID_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "An Ultra Chryssalid attack is similar to the standard type's, but the size of the proboscis and the egg itself makes it impossible for a human-sized victim to survive the process."

The gods are angry, the sky is blazing with lightning, almost every night now. The tower will fall, struck down in flames. The rats can be everywhere, rats wearing human guises. Rats must die if Man is to survive the great cleansing. Like Prometheus, I stole their secret fire, and I will use it to exact my wrath. The lightning...! It comes again...

They dress in furs and leather to show their 'self-raised, self-reliant sentient species pride' and they seem to follow a loose collection of New Age concepts, such as reincarnation beliefs or veganism. Although mostly well-educated, they seem to be rather easily manipulated by anyone with basic information control."

Now called Stormies, these kids maintain their subculture of physical abilities, combat prowess and free love - a subculture that was in fact created by the suppliers of this serum.

This process is quite dangerous and painful (you are subjected to all sorts of physical stress and feel feverish for days!), but the results are pretty awesome, as you can see. It also decreases intelligence and may cause destructive behavior, so you'd better stick with our X-Com solutions.{NEWLINE}Luchadores usually live in small groups and are fiercely territorial.

Now it is time to go home.{NEWLINE}Yes, this alien world is very interesting. But the Council thinks it's too early for serious exploration. Besides... I suspect they already have access to more worlds like this one. So they're starting to evacuate the base permanently.{NEWLINE}Whatever their reasons, they are very happy with our performance.

  STR_CYBERWEB_PORTAL_SYSTEM: "Cyberweb Portal System"
  STR_CYBERWEB_PORTAL_SYSTEM_UFOPEDIA: "The Cyberweb portal we have seized turned out to be one of many on Earth. Apparently the transdimensional tech the Cyberweb uses has its downsides: it can only be activated at certain times and locations, so in order to maintain a reasonable frequency of travel one must have many such installations around the globe. This means that if we are to travel beyond the portal, we will need to mind the clock as well.{NEWLINE}Another problem with these portals is that they are... leaky, meaning that apart from the main gate, smaller bubbles tend to spontaneously appear in the vicinity. If these miniportals emerge outside of the compound, it often leads to extradimensional creatures infiltrating the Earth. The Cyberweb doesn't seem to care much, though."
  STR_CYBERWEB_PLANS: "Cyberweb Plans"
  STR_CYBERWEB_PLANS_UFOPEDIA: "The documentation we have procured speaks about Cyberweb's project of developing portals to other dimensions. As improbable as it sounds, it seems they not only succeeded in doing just that, but have been sending personnel and materials through such 'Dimensional Portals' for a quite long time now, which suggests a major operation of theirs on the other side. The portal uses a medium called 'Subspace' and is highly unstable, which led to several accidents involving serious losses. In the end, however, Cyberweb developed a method of controlling it by directly hooking a battery of optronic supercomputers to it; still it is impossible to predict how long a portal will remain open. If we develop a way of tracking subspace disturbances caused by operating a portal, we can pinpoint it and dispatch a squad to seize it."

All access ways to the HQ are too heavily screened for us to slip by. The Council won't authorize a frontal assault either, out of concern the leaders will escape - something I totally agree with.

  STR_MONSTERS_FINAL_SOLUTION: "Monsters: Final Solution"
  STR_MONSTERS_FINAL_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Turns out that the creatures we keep fighting were indeed brought by aliens and are regularly distributed around the globe by UFOs. The creatures are dropped in pods, then they multiply and start threatening local populations.{NEWLINE}But no more. It took some effort, Commander, but with Syndicate data I managed to synthesize a chemical compound which violently reacts with mutant blood plasma, causing quick death and sometimes incineration. It is harmless to humans and may be dispersed from the air, making any outbreaks easy to control.{NEWLINE}We have already shared the formula with the founding governments.

Their design was further improved over the millennia of service. Modern Mutons proudly proclaim themselves as a servant caste of ferocious warriors, fanatically loyal to those they consider their creators. They function solely as part of the alien social machine, so they never formed any civilization of their own, but they have their own culture, reflecting on their predatory instincts and utter devotion. A key element of becoming an 'adult' Muton is to accept a permanent link with an Ethereal guide; once broken, it kills the Muton. This connection is considered the holiest of rituals and a sign of greatness."
  STR_SNAKEMEN_HOMEWORLD: "Planet of the Snakemen"
  STR_SNAKEMEN_HOMEWORLD_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}A Snakeman alien we have interrogated could remember its homeworld - apparently a rare case, since most Snakemen we encounter on Earth were bred in alien bases. Our specimen was a member of a primitive community of hunters, one of many such tribes inhabiting a distant planet with little surface water. The Snakeman mostly spoke of a yellowish sky with three suns, of scorched plateaus, and of river valleys where the aliens live. One day they were visited by 'gods', a more developed alien species, and many Snakemen volunteered to join the 'great hunting among the stars', including our prisoner. It seemed to genuinely miss its home; a rare instance of an alien displaying an emotion we can easily understand and empathize with."
  STR_SECTOID_LEGENDS: "Sectoid Legends"
  STR_SECTOID_LEGENDS_UFOPEDIA: "A Sectoid captive shared with us a story regarding the distant past of its species, where they succumbed to a more advanced race of 'Ethereals'. According to this myth-like story, the Sectoids joined the Ethereals in exchange for a promise to perfect their genetic design, allowing them to procreate normally and greatly enhancing their physical and mental capabilities. As far as they know, no such reward has materialized yet, but our Sectoid firmly believes it will come true one day. Such blind belief may seem completely irrational to us, but are we humans really much different?"
  STR_FLOATERS_HISTORY: "Floaters History"
  STR_FLOATERS_HISTORY_UFOPEDIA: "Eons ago, these so-called Floaters built a civilization on a distant planet that orbits two suns. Already challenged with an irradiated and erratic environment, they polluted their homeland so badly they almost went extinct. Then aliens known to us as Ethereals appeared, offering them cybernetic enhancement technology. Sacrificing most pleasures of the flesh and becoming a soldier race for the Ethereals was a price they paid happily."
  STR_ALIEN_RECREATIONAL_PROGRAMS: "Alien Recreational Programs"
  STR_ALIEN_RECREATIONAL_PROGRAMS_UFOPEDIA: "We have persuaded our alien captive to share some of his favorite recreational works, experienced by the alien entertainment. They are somewhat similar to films, but they have no actual plot, only psionic waves beamed directly to the brain to incite certain emotions, as well as basic images to enhance the experience. This alien particularly enjoys programs like (in very loose translation): Blissful Serenity, Anticipation of Reward, or Excitement of Hunting. In fact, it seems pretty addicted to this pastime."
  STR_ALIEN_SERVITORS: "Alien Servitors"
  STR_ALIEN_SERVITORS_UFOPEDIA: "Servitors are an organization excelusively composed of Ethereals. They seem to provide similar functions as normal low-rank Ethereals, so we don't know what their unique purpose may be other than that they perform military tasks outside the scope of the Ethereal Order, who commands regular alien soldiers. All members seem very old and bear marks of averted decay; apparently they are revived from death and somehow revigorated to serve the aliens once again. With their skills not much diminished, but their sense of self almost entirely gone. Is this a fate awaiting every Ethereal?"
  STR_ALIEN_KEEPERS: "Alien Keepers"
  STR_ALIEN_KEEPERS_UFOPEDIA: "Keepers are a rare alien rank exclusively populated by Ethereals. These high-ranked specialists are tasked with the critically important task of tending to alien brains, which function as nodes of the alien psionic network. They excel at psionics, even compared to most other Ethereals, but are specialized in information processing rather than warfare. They maintain an intimately close relationship with their psionic node, almost to the point of blending with the alien brain's neural matrix. These Ethereals are generally avoided by their brethren and considered an intermediary stage between an operator and a tool."
  STR_ALIEN_COMMANDERS: "Alien Commanders"
  STR_ALIEN_COMMANDERS_UFOPEDIA: "Commanders, the highest level of the alien field command structure, are responsible for all major military operations. They are mostly recruited from successful Leaders with enough command experience. They receive no further formal training, but instead spend some time with individuals who actually govern the entire alien force, learning secret knowledge and absorbing thoughts of 'higher beings' - quite literally, as psionic brainwashing is involved. When not on duty, they live a solitary life, rarely interacting with beings other than Leaders.{NEWLINE}Their understanding of alien operations is more than enough to confirm what we have already suspected: the aliens operate from Mars."
  STR_ALIEN_LEADERS: "Alien Leaders"
  STR_ALIEN_LEADERS_UFOPEDIA: "Leaders are usually selected from among Navigators, Engineers and Medics that display exceptional intellect and command skills. Unless war demands dictate otherwise, they are normally much older and more experienced than an average alien warrior. Before they are sent on missions, they undergo rigorous training and psionic conditioning to boost their abilities and morale. Despite their position of power, Leaders enjoy few actual privileges except for access to restricted data.{NEWLINE}Intelligence we gained from a Leader enabled us to identify several alien outposts throughout the Solar System, including an observation post and a refueling station on the Moon, a major base on Mars and several mining facilities in the asteroid belt. Our Leader was stationed on Mars, but they are unable to confirm if it is the place where alien HQ is located."
  STR_ALIEN_MEDICS: "Alien Medics"
  STR_ALIEN_MEDICS_UFOPEDIA: "Medics are particularly important to the alien war effort, since a lot of alien tech is organic. Medics are selected at birth (or draft when applicable), based on promising genetic traits. They receive full combat training, similar to Soldiers but entirely separate, and only start their medical education afterwards. They possess good knowledge on some specific portion of alien medical knowledge, but are poor at applying it without standard alien equipment. They generally don't interact with other castes much, except when providing medical services at alien 'health and augmentation centers' or when participating in away missions."
  STR_ALIEN_ENGINEERS: "Alien Engineers"
  STR_ALIEN_ENGINEERS_UFOPEDIA: "Engineers are a special caste within the alien ranks, trusted enough to be given knowledge of alien arcane equipment - some of it. Recruited from Soldiers, they spend their lives in totally secluded communities within the alien base - a monastery of sorts - until they are deemed ready for service. Engineers normally work in alien factories, putting together pieces of weaponry to be used against Earth, or maintain alien vessels on missions. However, despite their intelligence, they possess little actual scientific knowledge: their skill is mostly based on practice and repetition, without deeper understanding."
  STR_ALIEN_NAVIGATORS: "Alien Navigators"
  STR_ALIEN_NAVIGATORS_UFOPEDIA: "The Navigator caste stands considerably higher than the Soldiers, often acting as junior officers on less important missions. They also have access to certain secret information, necessary for piloting UFOs and other special tasks. Navigators are normally housed separately from Soldiers to prevent information leaks and undesired fraternization. Despite their privileged status, they still do not know where the aliens come from, except that it is somewhere within the Solar System."
  STR_ALIEN_SOLDIERS: "Alien Soldiers"
  STR_ALIEN_SOLDIERS_UFOPEDIA: "Our alien captive divulged some information regarding its bleak day-to-day existence among the invaders. It told us about vast metallic halls somewhere underground, endless training sessions using psionic equipment, eating from automatic food dispensers, sleeping in regeneration chambers and participating in VR sessions for entertainment. However, the specimen was completely unaware of where this alien base was located, or anything about the infrastructure of the alien forces that we didn't know already."
  STR_BEASTMAN: "Beastman"
  STR_BEASTMAN_FORMULA: "Beastman Formula"
  STR_BEASTMAN_FORMULA_UFOPEDIA: "The M.A.G.M.A. Corporation shared with us some very interesting data concerning human-animal hybrids. Apparently they acquired an ancient tablet originating from Assyria which describes, with scientific precision, some crucial aspects of combining human DNA with other mammals' DNA. We have no idea where the Assyrians learned this from, but the tablet is undoubtedly genuine."
  STR_TACTICAL_NEURAL_IMPLANT: "Tactical Neural Implant"
  STR_TACTICAL_NEURAL_IMPLANT_UFOPEDIA: "Our recent advancements in medicine have enabled us to equip our agents with a special microcomputer, wired directly into the brain. Tactical Neural Implant will significantly boost their reaction times and other combat abilities."

  STR_CYBERWEB_BRAIN_IMPLANT_UFOPEDIA: "All Cyberweb members have an implant installed in their brain, used for access to their own global computer network and to operate machines. Contrary to their other cybernetic augmentations, this one seems possible to be installed into a normal human within a reasonable timeframe. We could potentially use it to directly interface with our own machines, as long as we find a volunteer."

They then took an active role in battling other related threats, mostly cyborgs created on Earth by alien agents. After it was eventually disbanded, UNIT personnel participated in the Xenonauts project. Their scientific division never went far with the alien tech, but they invented a few gadgets, like anti-robot weaponry.{NEWLINE}We found the blueprints for: EMP Grenade."
  STR_XENONAUTS: "X-Com History: Xenonauts"
  STR_XENONAUTS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}It turns out that Kiryu-Kai and similar initiatives were not the first attempts to deal with the alien threat. We have uncovered a top-secret project from the 70's labeled 'Xenonaut Defense Force' which was a joint NATO-Warsaw Pact operation. Its main objective was countering means of thought control, but it also managed to complete a number of other scientific and training programs.{NEWLINE}The initiative was rather short-lived; it failed due to poor intelligence, limited budget and a number of unfortunate decisions, not to mention the agents overindulging in the 'mind enhancement serum' (thus gaining them the informal term of Psychonauts). However, its unique role during the Cold War should not be underestimated, nor should its scientific achievements, like the Xeno Combat Shield."
  STR_KIRYU_KAI: "X-Com History: Kiryu-Kai"
  STR_KIRYU_KAI_UFOPEDIA: "Before X-Com, many countries attempted to deal with the paranormal threat on their own. Arguably the most successful was a Japanese project codenamed 'Kiryu-Kai'. Having actually encountered and fought extraterrestrials, this organization was the source of most of our starting data and technologies. Unfortunately, the losses they suffered in combat combined with a sudden and mysterious drop of interest from the Japanese government led to premature termination of the project.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The most important piece of information we have received from the Kiryu-Kai is:{NEWLINE}'The invasion will begin on the 1st of January 1999, 12:00 GMT.'"

  STR_HIDDEN_CAVES_UFOPEDIA: "Our comparative study of migrating patterns of Spiders and Shamblers has shown that a vast and complex system of caverns exists deep underground. This network somehow has not been detected before and seems to radiate strange wave-particles which interfere with our scanners.{NEWLINE}We assume that there are nests in these caverns where these monsters breed. We should search and destroy these nests. Besides, who knows what secrets these caves may hold? You shall be notified if we find an entrance."
  STR_HIDDEN_CAVES_SEVERAL_BRIEFING: "You are about to enter an unknown cave, possibly a gate to the vast underworld. Your mission is to neutralize any threat this place may pose to the world outside. Hopefully you took some light sources with you. Good luck!"

Your mission is to neutralize any threat this place may pose to the world outside.{NEWLINE}Expect extremely tight and intricate passages. Remember to take some light sources with you. Explosives may also prove useful."
  STR_CQC: "Close Quarters Combat"
  STR_CQC_UFOPEDIA: "If you shoot an enemy from a neighboring tile, they will attempt to knock your weapon away or use some other hand-to-hand technique to defend themselves. You must overcome their defenses with a special close combat test, based on your and your foe's Melee and Reactions. The test also depends on the weapon you use (pistols are best, heavy weapons are worst). If you fail, your shot will go in a random direction; if you succeed, you fire normally.{NEWLINE}These rules do not apply to melee weapons or unarmed attacks."
  STR_UNARMED_COMBAT_UFOPEDIA: "Incapacitating enemies without using any weapons is challenging, but sometimes necessary. Delivering successful hits in unarmed combat depends equally on Melee and Reactions. Damage dealt depends on worn equipment, but most commonly relies upon Strength and Melee. Remember that most enemies can do the same to you, and some are highly proficient with martial arts.{NEWLINE}To attack with an empty hand, just click on the empty slot as with normal weapons."
  STR_MELEE_UFOPEDIA: "For most fighters, melee weapons are only for desperate situations, but some agents rather enjoy their strong points: power and speed."
  STR_PISTOLS_UFOPEDIA: "Pistols have a number of advantages: they suffer no penalty from one-handed use, are fast-firing, light and easy to carry. Their main problem is limited effective range."
  STR_SMGS_UFOPEDIA: "Sub-machine guns have long auto shots, are relatively light and have large clips. They also suffer less from being fired with one hand than other two-handed weapons, and some simply are one-handed. They are however quite inaccurate and their damage value is generally unimpressive."
  STR_RIFLES_UFOPEDIA: "Rifles are very accurate, also at long distances. They often have autofire mode. They are highly versatile, the only significant disadvantage being that they require both hands."
  STR_SHOTGUNS_UFOPEDIA: "Shotguns deal relatively high damage. They are fast and very accurate, but only at short distances. They often use buckshot ammunition which works great against lightly armored targets."
  STR_CANNONS_UFOPEDIA: "Cannons are big, bulky weapons that deal high damage. They tend to have decent Aimed Shot accuracy and average Snap Shot accuracy. Some Cannons also have Auto Shot mode and/or unusual ammo."
  STR_LAUNCHERS_UFOPEDIA: "Rocket launchers shoot self-propelled rockets, usually with an explosive charge. They are slow to use and can be heavy, but they deal massive damage and often have good damage radius."
  STR_MACHINE_GUNS_UFOPEDIA: "Machine Guns are powerful, accurate and have good, long auto shots. They are quite heavy though and have limited use other than suppressive fire."
  STR_SNIPER_RIFLES_UFOPEDIA: "Sniper Rifles require high Firing Accuracy to be effective, but in the right hands are extremely accurate and powerful. However, they are quite slow to fire. Their accuracy often drops at very short distances. They normally have increased armor penetration. They tend to profit from kneeling more than other weapons."
  STR_INCENDIARIES_UFOPEDIA: "Incendiary weapons deal direct damage and also cover an area with flames. Fire deals damage every turn to all units standing in it. Fire doesn't cause fatal wounds, but may cause immolation of the target unit. A burning unit will take damage every turn, as if it was standing in fire, and has a chance to stop burning every turn. Fire also drastically reduces morale, making the target prone to panicking. Armor does not protect from fire, but may in some cases reduce damage by a set percentage."

I expected him to spill the beans about some sort of alien masters, but no! Apparently these machines were provided by a secret organization called Cyberweb. We do not know if this Cyberweb is a part of some alien invasion plan, or maybe some get-rich-quick scheme, but considering their technological advancement I strongly suggest we start looking for them immediately.{NEWLINE}All we know about Cyberweb is that they maintain some sort of safehouse network around the world.

  STR_CYBERWEB_BATTERY: "Cyberweb Battery"
  STR_CYBERWEB_BATTERY_UFOPEDIA: "High-powered Cyberweb equipment relies on special batteries that seem to employ some very exotic physics. The battery does not contain any power source; instead it uses some sort of interdimensional suction to procure the energy from another plane, possibly another universe. It is not, however, eternal, as its structure easily crumbles under strain, only allowing for some energy to be transferred before it burns up. On the positive side, the battery is completely invisible to all forms of energy detection, unless it is active. The device seems rather experimental, but is very impressive.{NEWLINE}The same Cyberweb battery can be used to power various weapons and equipment, but each time it must be calibrated for a particular device. Various configurations are color-coded."
  STR_LIGHTNING_THROWER: "Lightning Thrower"
  STR_LIGHTNING_THROWER_UFOPEDIA: "This somewhat ramshackle weapon emits deadly electric discharges. Like normal lightning, they cause severe burns and shock. If the target survives, they are likely to be rendered unconscious. However, its power rapidly drops at distances beyond 12. The Lightning Thrower is powered with a Cyberweb battery."

  STR_STAFF_001_UFOPEDIA: "Commander! I am here to file a formal complaint regarding my working conditions. First thing in the morning I was awakened by that big oaf of a Quartermaster who kept banging a hammer against some junk. Just after I dealt with him, the prosectorium started blasting heavy metal at full volume, which I won't even comment on. And just as I returned from there and finally sat down to finish all the invoices, some poor bastard in the detention center started yelling like he was being skinned alive, which for all I know may have been literal, so I had to deal with the redhead bitch too! And the bastard didn't even have anything useful to tell.{NEWLINE}Seriously, if you don't do something about all this ruckus, I promise you I WILL, and YOU WILL ALL SUFFER. Some day."
  STR_STAFF_002: "Staff Input: What Interrogation?"
  STR_STAFF_002_UFOPEDIA: "Wha... what do you mean by 'the interrogation', Commander? I-I wasn't interrogating a thing!{NEWLINE}It's true! I swear I wasn't spending time with the Chief Medic, and she totally didn't leave a lit cigarette on the desk, and I assure you there was no unauthorized, inflammable stuff in my office. So as you can see, there's no way a prisoner burned alive while we were... busy! See, see what I mean?"
  STR_STAFF_003: "Staff Input: Cure for Cancer"
  STR_STAFF_003_UFOPEDIA: "Commander! We have interrogated the captive, and, well, you'll never guess! Apparently, this guy has the cure for cancer. THE CURE FOR CANCER! Can you imagine? I have no idea how he even got something like this, this is some super secret stuff. Oh well, not any more!{NEWLINE}Of course it's not like it we can use it for our work, but we might at least gain a few sympathizers on the Council.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}(50 points awarded)"
  STR_STAFF_004: "Staff Input: Smooth Moves"
  STR_STAFF_004_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, regarding the interrogation of that Black Lotus guy, I have some bad news and some good news. The bad news is that he actually displayed some mad ninja skills, meaning he escaped from a high-security room (chaincuffed), broke a metal wall panel, seriously damaged our ventilation system and scared the bejesus out of two cleaning ladies. The good news is when I confronted him and put him back in jail, I picked up one niiiiice move from him. I might call it 'fabulous acrobatic ninja neckbreaker jump'. Wanna check it out?"
  STR_STAFF_005: "Staff Input: Russian Tunes"
  STR_STAFF_005_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, have you seen that Red Dawn guy we've interrogated? A terrific lad! He didn't know much beyond what we already knew, but he turned out to be such a great accordion player! And what a voice! I'm really sorry to let him go to some prison where his talents will be wasted. How about we keep him around for some much-needed morale boosts, eh?"
  STR_STAFF_006: "Staff Input: Applied Linguistics"

  STR_STAFF_008: "Staff Input: Point of Perspective"
  STR_STAFF_008_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, I lent some assistance with the interrogation of our recent captive. Actually, I used the grenade-in-mouth trick to convince them to talk. They suddenly got much more talkative, but in the end we didn't learn anything of use. But I had an illuminating thought:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}When all you have is a primed grenade, all problems are best dealt with under an open sky."

  STR_STAFF_009_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, I had a really weird dream last night... In it, X-Com fought naked, malformed giants who were only susceptible to melee weapons and only had bypassable armor in the rear. It was pretty scary overall, but at least the Chief Scientist was a hot crazy babe, so there was that.{NEWLINE}I wonder if I'll ever see a continuation of this dream! I'm quite excited!"
  STR_STAFF_010: "Staff Input: Sewage Problems"
  STR_STAFF_010_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, some locals have reported a strange creature sighted nearby. I looked around a little when I went for a walk, and luckily, I managed to shoot it - it looked like a giant newt with legs and big teeth. So the problem was solved, but I suggest that from now on, we should pay more attention as to the contents of our sewage."
  STR_STAFF_011: "Staff Input: An Important Message"
  STR_STAFF_011_UFOPEDIA: "You'd think that some of the people these cults try to recruit would go to the news and expose them. Yet somehow, it doesn't happen. Did you ever wonder why that is? Are these poor idiots brainwashed and blackmailed to the point that not a single fish slips the net? I can personally attest that nothing assures loyalty, love and cooperation like a carefully prepared set of drugs... That reminds me, I need to go back to my work.

The old ones you got me broke while I was using them. And, yes, we need a new chair... Because the old one has holes in the seat! ... Yes, that's right, holes... While you're at it can we get a 50 gallon drum, the bucket just isn't... never mind, I'll go ask one of the hangar boys if we can Strategically Transport Equipment to Alternate Locations...'{NEWLINE}Of course I was appalled.

  STR_STAFF_014_UFOPEDIA: "Why farmers? There are plenty of other remote denizens out there: hunters, trail hikers, preppers... so why farmers?

  STR_STAFF_015_UFOPEDIA: "Oh Lord, why does it always have to be bugs? Why couldn't mutations transform things into cute stuff, like bunnies or turtles? These mutations always make things scary, deadly, and creepy. I get shivers from these thoughts. I need a drink..."
  STR_STAFF_016: "Staff Input: Mysterious Man"
  STR_STAFF_016_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, the Man in Black we've captured - I know even you call them that! - says he can't remember a thing. Says last thing he remembers is that he was walking to the store. He gave us his name, address, everything. And it seems to match reality! This guy really exists! His wife is super worried! You know Commander, this is probably way deeper than we thought."
  STR_STAFF_017: "Staff Input: Blasphemous Crossbreeding"
  STR_STAFF_017_UFOPEDIA: "No Commander, I assure you that it is NOT possible to crossbreed Deep Ones with humans. There is no way these two life forms may produce any kind of offspring; their genomes are much too different.{NEWLINE}On the other hand, we have already seen things that literally should not be..."
  STR_STAFF_018: "Staff Input: The Insidious Plot"
  STR_STAFF_018_UFOPEDIA: "You know what I hate Commander? That the new games don't keep their saves in their own damn folders. What kind of a sicko would force storing them in some obscure location? It's practically a war crime!{NEWLINE}You think it may be them Hybrids? They do all sorts of messed up shit. Who else could have had such a horrible idea?"
  STR_STAFF_019: "Staff Input: Doctor's Way"
  STR_STAFF_019_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, I know these past weeks were pretty stressful for you. I also know about that last fruitless interrogation, which probably didn't help either. Therefore, as a medical doctor, I recommend these brightly colored pills of my personal design. Take one after breakfast and one in the evening, they will make you feel much better. Trust me, they are thoroughly tested."
  STR_STAFF_020: "Staff Input: Stature of Science"
  STR_STAFF_020_UFOPEDIA: "Have you noticed, Commander, that we no longer get scientists as villains on TV? Now if there is a scientist character at all, they are usually on the good side, like a fatherly figure or a trusted friend to the main protagonist. No cackling mad scientists to be found, nobody wants to steal the proverbial Moon.{NEWLINE}You might think it's a good thing for science that it is associated with positive imagery rather than feared. But I think that on a deeper level it is a sign that science has lost its gravity. It is not feared, therefore it is not really taken seriously by the general public. It was reduced to a useful resource, only supporting one side in the fight between good and evil. We are no longer respected as a force of civilization, we are mere janitors of knowledge!{NEWLINE}...And that is why I was rude to the Chief Accountant earlier today, Commander. I'm sorry, this won't happen again."
  STR_STAFF_021: "Staff Input: Why We Can't Have Nice Things"
  STR_STAFF_021_UFOPEDIA: "No, Commander, we cannot use Reapers as cavalry. Yes, it would be awesome and Reapers are very fluffy. But it would violate X-Com protocols regarding maximum unit height. Sorry!"
  STR_STAFF_022: "Staff Input: Spooky Picture"
  STR_STAFF_022_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, I don't believe in criticizing art, but that Chryssalid picture by the mess hall... Well, I admit it was a funny idea to make a big Chryssalid poster and hang it right in the middle of the base as a decoration. Agents were laughing about it too. What a prank, right? So, they're not laughing any more. In fact, I think our mess hall is suspiciously empty. So I think maybe it's time to remove it.{NEWLINE}By the way, do you have any plans for that poster? If not, perhaps it would look nice in the prosectorium..."
  STR_STAFF_023: "Staff Input: The Tyson Challenge"
  STR_STAFF_023_UFOPEDIA: "There is a popular topic circulating around the base. It is discussed what would be the odds of beating the whole alien invasion single-handedly, using only fists as weapons. What would be the odds indeed, Commander? It got me wondering for a while. But in the end I concluded I would probably lack the required patience..."
  STR_STAFF_024: "Staff Input: Frontier Psychiatrists"
  STR_STAFF_024_UFOPEDIA: "Isn't it strange that the public image of psychiatry is a therapist who asks their patient questions? Strange it is, because what psychiatry should really focus on instead is people who do not want to answer any questions. After all, gathering information from people who are eager to answer questions does not really require specialists.{NEWLINE}Isn't it part of what we, X-Com, are about?"
  STR_STAFF_025: "Staff Input: The Call of Coding"
  STR_STAFF_025_UFOPEDIA: "WHAT, why would it work like that, that makes no sense! Oh, Commander, I didn't see you there. No, I wasn't shouting about someone's commented code - or lack thereof. What do you mean I was disturbing the prisoners?"
  STR_STAFF_026: "Staff Input: Flashlights"
  STR_STAFF_026_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, you need to take a look at our expense reports. See right there, under our wages for the month? That's right, we're spending over 2 grand on flashlights. Not $2,000 total, $2,000 each! Where did you even find such an expensive flashlight?! It would be cheaper to carry golden chandeliers into battle! Why can't we just drive down to the hardware store and buy flashlights for like $10? Is there really that much red tape just to buy a flashlight?"
  STR_STAFF_027: "Staff Input: Fun with Terms"
  STR_STAFF_027_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, I really think you should not refer to the Harvester ship as a 'Cattlebruiser'. I know the agents commonly do this, and I understand the value of humor as well as bonding with the men, but this term doesn't look good in official debriefing transcripts. Especially in Central Asia."
  STR_STAFF_028: "Staff Input: Future Wars"
  STR_STAFF_028_UFOPEDIA: "Comm'der, I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about these fancy new Laser weapons. I've always felt our weapons were good but not great. Too many moving parts, too much complexity in pushing a bit of metal through the air. I've always thought there must be a better way of making the other bastard die for his country, and these Lasers prove me right!{NEWLINE}I say we embrace this new tech, Comm'der. Let's issue Lasers to all our personnel and never look back. In fact, I've taken the liberty of contacting the Council about this new SOP, and I've also put in a request for a new name for our organization. 'X-Com' is hardly fitting for a team of tough, Laser totin' badasses, is it? So I've suggested we be called 'Laser Squad' from now on. No need for you to do anything, Comm'der, they've asked me not to call them about it - they'll call me - so the changes should be approved soon. I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything."
  STR_STAFF_029: "Staff Input: Nothing Is Scarier"
  STR_STAFF_029_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, this Minotaur creature... It looks rather absurd to modern humans, even silly. A man with a bull's head? It is a miracle that something like this can survive at all in the real world, so outlandish, so naive, this idea is.{NEWLINE}...Then why does it chill me to the bone? I can't look at it, can't even think about it, without feeling dread. And I find this strange phobia fascinating. Of all the cosmic horrors we know, why Minotaur? Why not something more alien, powerful, more... serious? At first I thought it was because it threatened my scientific ideas of what is possible, but now I truly understand: it is the incarnation of the old myth of Theseus' journey, one of the most primal monsters known to man. It is the bare, sheer horror of blasphemy, a mixture of human and an animal, the worst parts of both. It is a reminder of who we are: nothing but animals under a thin veneer of civilization and culture."
  STR_STAFF_030: "Staff Input: Vanishing Points"
  STR_STAFF_030_UFOPEDIA: "Interrogating Men in Black is really frustrating. When you finally get some contact from them, you go arrest the guy, but guess what, he's not home! He literally disappeared, even though he was seen here yesterday! Happens, like, every single time... Hrmph.{NEWLINE}Honestly, sometimes I wonder if they aren't slipping away through the sewers. They even look like they were on really bad terms with the ninja turtles."
  STR_STAFF_031: "Staff Input: Laser Weapons Safety"
  STR_STAFF_031_UFOPEDIA: "I know the laser technology is fun and all, but I need to lay some ground rules.{NEWLINE}1. No using lasers to graffiti walls. Stick to a 'permanent' marker.{NEWLINE}2. No using lasers as a 'really effective' Power Point presentation tool.{NEWLINE}3. No using lasers as toys for test animals. It's only cute until they catch the red dot.{NEWLINE}4. NO PUTTING PRISMS ON LASERS FOR A DISCO BALL EFFECT. I swear to God if I find out who did this, I will put them up for execution."
  STR_STAFF_032: "Staff Input: Reading Manuals"

  STR_DEEP_ONE_SOLDIER: "Deep One Servant"
  STR_DEEP_ONE_ARMOR: "Deep One Combat Analysis"
  STR_DEEP_ONE: "Deep One"
  STR_DEEP_ONE_UFOPEDIA: "Almost human, this strange creature appears to be a reptilian humanoid very closely related to man. They are stronger and tougher than humans. Deep Ones are a fully fledged race, there being male and female specimens of varying ages. These creatures are definitely sentient and can hold a conversation, albeit rather simple in reasoning. They describe themselves as 'peasants' or 'servants', though the nature of their masters is as ambiguous as it gets. As creatures of both the deep sea and the surface, they are resistant to explosions and other forms of pressure-based damage."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_AUTOPSY: "Deep One Autopsy"
  STR_DEEP_ONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Genetic analysis suggests that this creature is related to normal Earth life forms, but very ancient ones - from around the Cretaceous period. Otherwise it's a fairly standard humanoid, if we can call it that, with all the natural organs we can expect from a depth dweller who can also breathe air. A small electronic device is lodged in its skull."

  STR_AQUATOID: "Aquatoid"
  STR_AQUATOID_AUTOPSY: "Aquatoid Autopsy"
  STR_AQUATOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A detailed analysis of this creature allows us to make some basic assumptions. It is similar to a Sectoid, but changed by surgical methods and implants to be an aquatic creature. Vestigial lungs allow the breathing of air and limited surface mobility. There are cybernetic implants throughout the body, enhancing the strength of its atrophied limbs and the function of its organs. As all the members of this race are identical, we may hypothesize that these creatures are clones."
  STR_AQUATOID_UFOPEDIA: "The Aquatoids is an ancient society, having existed millennia before man's first faltering steps upon the world. Their compact form and bulbous features are a throwback to their space faring brethren, the Sectoids. Aquatoids seek to propagate their sterile race through the genetic modification of other races. As it turns out, humans are the ideal subjects for this. Experiments have spawned numerous hybrid races."
  STR_AQUATOID_CORPSE: "Aquatoid Corpse"
  STR_TENTACULAT_WEAPON: "Tentaculat's Tentacles"
  STR_TENTACULAT_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "Tentaculat attacks cause instant 'zombification' of the target and turn it into a mindless aquatic life form. Due to a very small sample, this mechanism is poorly understood."

  STR_TENTACULAT_UFOPEDIA: "Not even the depths of a Lovecraftian nightmare could spawn something like this indescribable creature. No comparison to any Earth animal exists, the environment that could produce such as this is beyond imagination. Armed with long tentacles the Tentaculat paralyzes its victims, then transmutes them into mindless things. These progeny can cause death on touch, even through armor."
  STR_TENTACULAT_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Our autopsy has revealed a myriad of small cybernetic implants that are lodged in the creature's large brain. It possesses receptors for visible light as well as for thermal imaging, so this monster can navigate with unerring accuracy even in the inky depths of the ocean. Its internal organs are mostly vestigial, just barely sufficient to sustain it. An external connector leads into its small stomach, so it is logical to assume it is fed nutrients directly by its masters."

  STR_TASOTH_SOLDIER: "Tasoth Commando"
  STR_TASOTH_CORPSE: "Tasoth Corpse"
  STR_TASOTH_AUTOPSY: "Tasoth Autopsy"
  STR_TASOTH_UFOPEDIA: "Vastly more powerful than a man, the Tasoth is a true alien and its behavior and carnivorous nature are unmatched on the planet. The Tasoth seems perfect to form the spearhead of an alien attack, as it never seems to shrink from the fight even in the face of overwhelming odds."
  STR_TASOTH_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Dissection revealed a cybernetic organism possessed of strange power. Inside the body cavity is a small power unit, but no identifiable organs. The power is transmitted throughout the body by a bio-electric transmission system. The body wholly lacks bones or any other supporting structure. Once dead the power stops and the creature becomes a lifeless rag doll of oozing alien flesh and fluids. The only other internal construction is a pair of ceramic cells, which if energized briefly revive the creature."
  STR_DESTROY_TASOTH: "Destroy Tasoth Factory"
  STR_DESTROY_TASOTH_UFOPEDIA: "Commander! We have successfully implanted the viral data in the Tasoth factory and caused its... violent shutdown. Oh, you should have seen the fireworks!{NEWLINE}We have dealt the undersea aliens from T'leth a critical blow. After the destruction of the Tasoth factory, they seemingly withdrew their forces to the depths and ceased all surface activities. It appears we won't see them any time soon. While I have no doubts they will return, I think we can leave this problem to our grandchildren. Now, let's party!"
  STR_TASOTH_DATA_PAD: "Tasoth Creation Data Pad"
  STR_TASOTH_DATA_PAD_UFOPEDIA: "This device contains complete information on how to breed Tasoths from scratch. It is crucial to the process of creating the unstoppable army of Dagon.{NEWLINE}While we are unable to duplicate the process, we understand enough of it to disrupt it. We should hack into the alien factory mainframe and substitute the original files with our own. This will cause the entire facility to break down and eventually explode when the Zrbite buildup in its system reaches critical mass. This should eliminate the Tasoth menace, or at least delay it for a long time."

  STR_TASOTH_FACTORY_DESCRIPTION: "The plan is to infiltrate an industrial complex that produces Tasoth troops, deep beneath the ocean floor.

  STR_BLACK_LOTUS_HQ: "Black Lotus HQ"
  STR_BLACK_LOTUS_HQ_UFOPEDIA: "We now know that the Black Lotus sect was established and is still directly governed by an extraterrestrial intelligence known as The Golden Lady who can manifest physically through psionic possession of its subjects. While we do not know the exact nature of this intelligence, we do understand in detail how it operates: it uses a psionic amplifier to direct its mental focus in order to 'possess' people.{NEWLINE}This amplifier is located in the Black Lotus headquarters, inside a golden statue representing The Golden Lady. If we capture it, we should be able to decipher its signal pattern and find a way to disable it, thus denying the alien mistress the ability to manifest and control its servants.{NEWLINE}We now have enough intelligence data to locate the HQ and choose the right time to raid it. You will be notified when an opportunity comes up, but expect strong resistance."
  STR_ZSRR_HQ: "Red Dawn HQ"
  STR_ZSRR_HQ_UFOPEDIA: "We now have enough data to understand Red Dawn's structure: it is a parasitic organization, thriving within various military and governmental agencies in Eastern Europe and Asia. Almost all of its higher members are military or intelligence officers with access to top secret data and various resources. This is one of their greatest strengths, but we can turn it into a weakness: any exposed Red Dawn member should be easy to track down and neutralize by their official employer, without us having to lift a finger.{NEWLINE}Here's the plan: we should locate Red Dawn's main base, located somewhere in Siberia, and snatch all personal data we can find. With this information we should be able to seriously undermine the organization and possibly wipe it out entirely. I will notify you as soon as we find an opportunity to attack. Of course we can expect extreme resistance, so be prepared for a difficult battle."
  STR_CHURCH_OF_DAGON_HQ: "Church of Dagon HQ"
  STR_CHURCH_OF_DAGON_HQ_UFOPEDIA: "According to the information we 'obtained' from the Sorcerer, the Church of Dagon maintains a network of stony pyramids in Equatorial Africa. These pyramids are used as bases, and one of them - the High Temple - contains a golden statue that appears to be the holiest object of the cult, the greatest gift of Dagon. We don't know what exactly this statue is, but if we capture it, it should cripple the cult like nothing else.{NEWLINE}The problem is that the statue often changes location between the pyramids, but we can still trace it with reasonable accuracy. After all, a High Temple is a High Temple, right?{NEWLINE}I'll let you know when we locate that golden statue and you'll decide whether we're ready for some action or not."
  STR_EXALT_HQ: "EXALT HQ"
  STR_EXALT_HQ_UFOPEDIA: "We now understand that EXALT does not produce Psiclone by itself; the devices are being supplied to them through an even more secretive network. This network has a permanent representative that can be found in EXALT's main base of operations. What's more, this representative is supposedly a half-alien! If we capture and interrogate this mysterious hybrid, we should be able to destroy the Psiclone chain of supply. Without Psiclone, EXALT will surely collapse.{NEWLINE}We now possess enough data to find the EXALT main base soon. You will be notified when we are able to strike. Naturally, this operation will be quite demanding, so prepare your best agents and equipment."

  STR_DURATHREAD_FACTORY_LOCATION_UFOPEDIA: "We knew that the durathread we've recovered is produced by the Red Dawn, but we didn't know where. But now we are able to pinpoint the location of their manufacturing plant. We should raid it and gather data to replicate this technology for our use."
  STR_DURATHREAD_FACTORY_DESCRIPTION: "Here lies a small manufacturing complex where durathread is produced.

  STR_TOMB_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: "Having regrown even more human neural tissue, these former Infectors are smart enough to develop some consciousness. They are not exactly human, but surprisingly close: capable of basic communication, some abstract thinking and social interaction. Their brains are almost completely human; the parasite is still there, but because of how primitive it is, its influence on thought processes is negligible. Tomb Guardians command lesser Zombies with biochemical signals, using them as drones, soldiers and emergency food. Having very limited knowledge about the world, they eagerly collect all sorts of objects for examination."
  STR_TOMB_GUARD_AUTOPSY: "Tomb Guardian Autopsy"
  STR_TOMB_GUARD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This specimen has a well-developed brain, with the alien parasite buried within it.

  STR_STRIX_UFOPEDIA: "Despite its exotic biology, this creature appears to resemble more a human than the Infector it evolved from. It is rather intelligent and capable of basic speech, though its psychology is simple and child-like. Since it can synthesize blood plasma, the Strix rarely eats other Zombies, but sometimes feeds on large animals, including humans. It has the ability to recruit lesser Zombies by tempting them with food and then making them into her personal drones. As opposed to earlier Zombies, it has a stable physiology and prolonged lifespan."
  STR_STRIX_AUTOPSY: "Strix Autopsy"
  STR_STRIX_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Clearly a further stage of an Infector, this Zombie type holds large amounts of bioenergy, but appears to store it rather than use it. Nevertheless, its organs are highly developed, particularly the brain and digestive tract. Despite its exotic biology, it appears to resemble a human more than an Infector.

  STR_GHOUL_SOLDIER: "Ghoul"
  STR_GHOUL_CORPSE: "Ghoul Corpse"
  STR_GHOUL_UFOPEDIA: "This type of Zombie is similar to the base type, but special diet provided by a 'Strix' provides it with enough bioplasma to stabilize its metabolism at the cost of some body mass. Moreover, special hormones present in the food heavily affect its biology, abandoning procreation for general development. Ghouls are fast, fairly strong and surprisingly intelligent: they use objects, understand simple verbal commands and display social awareness. They are somewhat capable of speech, but not very responsive to stimuli and have little in the way of self-preservation, focusing on protecting their hive instead."
  STR_GHOUL_AUTOPSY: "Ghoul Autopsy"
  STR_GHOUL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Zombie is significantly leaner and lighter than the standard type. The physiology is similar, but the body contains little energetic plasma. Also the cerebral tissues are very well developed, including advanced structures like in a normal human brain.

  STR_VAMPIRE_KNIGHT_CORPSE: "Vampire Knight Corpse"
  STR_VAMPIRE_KNIGHT_UFOPEDIA: "This Zombie type is sentient and quite intelligent, though has limited understanding of humans. Thanks to its unearthly physiology, it draws energy from the planet itself in various forms; the rest he acquires directly from the soil when hibernating or by extracting fluids from other organisms. It is significantly more proactive and curious than the earlier forms. It has good social skills and maintains relationships with other high-tier Zombies, as well as commands lesser Zombies with vast empathic powers."
  STR_VAMPIRE_KNIGHT_AUTOPSY: "Vampire Knight Autopsy"
  STR_VAMPIRE_KNIGHT_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Zombie looks very human on the outside. Its chemistry is completely different from a Tomb Guardian's: the cellular energy levels are off the scale, but there is very little actual metabolism going on. Moreover, there is very little energy in its blood. This means that the Vampire does not actually use the hyperenergetic chemical that earlier stages do. Oh, and there are no fangs, just body parts of the parasite that can crawl out of the vampire's mouth to feed on captured humans."

  STR_VAMPIRE_QUEEN_COMMANDER: "Vampire Queen"
  STR_VAMPIRE_QUEEN_CORPSE: "Vampire Queen Corpse"
  STR_VAMPIRE_QUEEN_UFOPEDIA: "The Vampire Queen emerges in larger groups of Vampires. Her position is mostly a social construct, since Vampires tend to form hierarchical relationships, but her power is enforced with psionic and chemical control over her subjects. She is highly intelligent and possesses a strong self-consciousness, Commanding large numbers of subjects and personally powerful, the Vampire Queen makes a deadly enemy - or a fascinating interlocutor."
  STR_VAMPIRE_QUEEN_AUTOPSY: "Vampire Queen Autopsy"

  STR_MUMMY_MATRIARCH: "Mummy Matriarch"
  STR_MUMMY_UFOPEDIA: "Even more powerful than Vampires, Mummies are the ultimate form of Zombie. With extremely high energy levels and perfect efficiency, they utilize 100% of their mind and body potential. They shrug off significant damage, maintain a psi shield and can manifest raw energy in the form of violent explosions. With complete power over lesser Zombies, they can lead entire parasite armies and rule over small underground kingdoms."
  STR_MUMMY_AUTOPSY: "Mummy Autopsy"
  STR_MUMMY_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This form is similar to a Vampire, but there are some notable, if subtle, differences. The metabolism is roughly the same, but the Mummy also stores energetic blood plasma inside her body, much like a Strix. The brain is very well-developed. Barring the wounds which killed it directly, the corpse shows no damage or imperfection."

In fact, we might be looking at the most efficient biological fuel known to science.{NEWLINE}However, in order to further our understanding of this phenomenon, I will need a better laboratory. I will be happy to provide the necessary plans as soon as they're complete. In the meantime, I suggest we extract as much of this substance from corpses as possible."
  STR_MUTANT_PHYSIOLOGY: "Mutant Physiology"
  STR_MUTANT_PHYSIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "I have analyzed large samples of that big creature you've brought me and I have arrived at some interesting conclusions. Firstly, while we haven't found any direct evidence of bioengineering, there are many indications that it was designed for some specific purpose. Secondly, we have discovered a strange chemical compound in the creature's bloodstream, one that I cannot identify despite numerous cross-references. However, it brings us to number three: this compound is extremely energetic and my observations show that the creature's tissues use this energy as fuel. Pursuing this path is unfortunately outside my area of expertise, but if we manage to crack this mysterious molecule, I have an idea how to use it to improve our medical field equipment."
  STR_EXALT_OPERATIONS: "EXALT Operations"

  STR_BLACK_LOTUS_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, infiltrating a network of East-Asian shady businesses was not easy, but it was certainly exciting! Anyway, now we have access to some of their trusted sources, mostly computer servers and such, and we can get some idea on where their masters may live. Data analysis isn't perfect, but we have a chance of locating a high-ranking Black Lotus member whenever they receive an e-mail or pay for groceries from an account we know of.

  STR_CHURCH_OF_DAGON_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, I have devised a plan on how to capture a cult leader. We already know that they can be found at parties devoted to Dagon, performing all sorts of evil rituals and probably enjoying themselves, too. Now I have a fairly good idea on how to calculate when and where this ceremony will take place.

  STR_EXALT_NETWORK: "EXALT Network"
  STR_EXALT_NETWORK_UFOPEDIA: "With a monopoly on Psiclone and backed by wealthy people, EXALT is very influential. Its agents hail from all social strata, but generally it is governed by individuals connected to the political elites of the Americas. If we want to get to these people, we should locate their delegates who supervise Psiclone distribution, command mid-level operations and so on. Finding them shouldn't be too hard; I'll let you know if something comes up."
  STR_ZSRR_NETWORK: "Red Dawn Network"
  STR_ZSRR_NETWORK_UFOPEDIA: "The Red Dawn has good connections both in the army and in business circles. I don't mean just the big business, but also shop owners, car mechanics and the like. All of them provide good places for all sorts of activity, from meetings and military briefings to combat training and maybe even doing science. If we place these locations under surveillance, we may have a chance of surprising them while they are there, hopefully with some higher-ranking officer. If we manage to even get to them, that is."
  STR_BLACK_LOTUS_NETWORK: "Black Lotus Network"
  STR_BLACK_LOTUS_NETWORK_UFOPEDIA: "Black Lotus activity is not limited to outposts; in fact, the interesting stuff begins a level above, within more permanent hideouts. These buildings, owned by various organizations on paper but in reality belonging to the Black Lotus only, function as local data centers, training grounds and storage facilities. This is a big chance for us to capture a higher-ranking member of this cult, but they'll probably be protected by a host of well-trained bodyguards, so there's that.{NEWLINE}A 'host' is such an awesome word, no?"
  STR_CHURCH_OF_DAGON_NETWORK: "Church of Dagon Network"
  STR_CHURCH_OF_DAGON_NETWORK_UFOPEDIA: "The Church of Dagon is a secretive organization, with many members hardly ever leaving their settlements. It does, however, maintain a network of emergency storage facilities, usually hidden in remote areas and always guarded by a group of Church members. These facilities are our best bet to apprehend the cult's leaders, since they often use the hideouts to contact each other and coordinate cooperation between the villages. We don't know what's really taking place there, but it's definitely fishy."

  STR_ELDRITCH_LANGUAGE_UFOPEDIA: "This is allegedly the oldest living language on Earth, spoken by the so-called 'depth dwellers'. At this point I am unable to say if this claim is true, but I guess we can be sure that the language is real: it is not only quite complex, but also very different from most human languages.

  STR_CONTACT_CULT_ARMS_DEALERS_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, at this point we have infiltrated cultists deep enough to get a little cheeky.

  STR_SHAMBLER_UFOPEDIA: "Adapted to cold temperatures, Shamblers roam ice fields and mountain glaciers, feeding on any meat they encounter - including humans. Their origin is uncertain, but they probably come from some distant past and were recently reawakened by some natural phenomenon or human activity, and their sudden cosmopolitan distribution suggests deliberate action. Needless to say, they are extremely dangerous in close encounters.{NEWLINE}Warning: Shamblers respond poorly to explosives. Their shimmering fur can make them harder to target."
  STR_SHAMBLER_AUTOPSY: "Shambler Autopsy"
  STR_SHAMBLER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is heavily muscled and indubitably very strong. Thick fur gives it good protection against cold, heat, chemicals, shockwaves and small-caliber firearms, but is somewhat flammable. It is technically a sloth, or at least their close relative, and is considered a living fossil."

  STR_FENRIR_TERRORIST: "Fenrir Wolf"
  STR_FENRIR_UFOPEDIA: "Fenrir Wolves are large, strong and extremely aggressive canines. Unlike common wolves, they are solitary creatures, which can be explained by the large amount of food they require. Fenrirs are mostly seen in cold environments of the Northern hemisphere, but they are also known to wander southwards to more temperate zones. They will attack anything they consider to be food, including humans and even automobiles. While not numerous, they can be a serious problem for human communities.{NEWLINE}Their shimmering fur can make them harder to target."
  STR_FENRIR_AUTOPSY: "Fenrir Wolf Autopsy"
  STR_FENRIR_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Fenrir Wolves are large canines, not much different from normal wolves apart from their large size. Well-developed muscles ensure great strength and agility, as well as some protection against projectiles. On the other hand, their fur is susceptible to fire."

  STR_SPIKEBOAR_UFOPEDIA: "Spikeboars predominantly appear in forests, needing a lot of food and water to sustain themselves. They are omnivores, mostly feeding on plant leaves but given the opportunity they will also eat animals of all sizes, including humans. When upset, the creature shoots pointy spikes at the offender which are dangerous even to armored targets."
  STR_SPIKEBOAR_AUTOPSY: "Spikeboar Autopsy"
  STR_SPIKEBOAR_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This large creature bears no resemblance to modern life forms, but is certainly a vertebrate, which suggests common origins with terrestrial life. They have tough skin and their body is covered in needles, much like a porcupine, giving it additional protection. These needles are attached to specialized muscles which seem to be able to eject the needles with great force."

  STR_SHADOWBAT_AUTOPSY: "Shadowbat Autopsy"
  STR_SHADOWBAT_UFOPEDIA: "Shadowbats are bigger and more aggressive than most other members of suborder Microchiroptera. They may be just a nuisance to an experienced agent, but their stealth and speed should not be underestimated. Oh, and they indeed are blood-sucking bats, with a special taste for human blood."
  STR_SHADOWBAT_TERRORIST: "Shadowbat"
  STR_SHADOWBAT_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This bat is unusually large, but otherwise no different from regular tropical bats. It is equipped with extremely sharp fangs, able to cut effortlessly through most soft materials, like leather or elephant skin."
  STR_MONGORN_CULTURE: "Mongorn Culture"
  STR_MONGORN_CULTURE_UFOPEDIA: "The study of this unusual Mongorn allows us to conclude that it is something like a tribal leader. Distinguished by more advanced muscles and fangs, it is much more aggressive than its relatives. In addition, it demonstrates more developed intellectual abilities. It knows how to use tools and is not afraid of fire, maybe can even use it. When bored, it paints strange patterns on the wall.{NEWLINE}This completely changes our ideas about the culture of Mongorns. We don't understand the cause why only its brain underwent such dramatic changes, but not the rest of the anatomy; this is probably a manifestation of artificial mutogenesis, but such complex genetic manipulations lie far beyond the limits of contemporary science."

  STR_MONGORN_UFOPEDIA: "First discovered in Mongolia, mongorns roam the Eurasian plains in search of food and are very aggressive. Although not fully intelligent, mongorns seem to understand most of what we communicate to them, but they always respond with aggression. It is unclear how such an unreasonable creature could survive in the wilderness at all, but it is possible that they were somehow conditioned to hate and attack humans whenever possible. These creatures are troublesome to deal with, as their keen senses and animal cunning make them difficult to hunt from the air."
  STR_MONGORN_AUTOPSY: "Mongorn Autopsy"
  STR_MONGORN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is clearly a result of genetic experimentation. It possesses genes of humans as well as other primates, with some patterns that are unknown to Earth science. They stand at almost 3 meters tall, possess great strength and a tough hide. Their fur is flammable, which can possibly be exploited in battle."
  STR_CULT_BASE: "Cult Base"
  STR_ANCIENT_ZOMBIES: "Ancient Zombies"
  STR_ANCIENT_ZOMBIES_UFOPEDIA: "We have discovered an astounding fact: a small Zombie apocalypse has already happened on Earth at least once. Thousands of years ago there was an outbreak of a Zombie plague in Africa, caused by the same type of parasite. That event resulted in creating Zombie forms similar to the ones we know, culminating in the powerful Mummies. Those Mummies waged wars against each other and also against non-Zombies, and most of them ultimately receded underground to hide from the world. These ancient Mummies are still down there, with only a shadow of their old power but still incredibly wise and intelligent. Now another generation of Zombies has appeared on the surface, and the new Zombies plan to conquer their older sisters' domains for knowledge and artifacts.{NEWLINE}Perhaps it would be a good idea to talk to these ancient Mummies, considering they don't seem hostile to humanity and we have a common enemy."
  STR_ZOMBIE_OVERLORDS: "Zombie Overlords"
  STR_ZOMBIE_OVERLORDS_UFOPEDIA: "Vampire Queens, insanely powerful as they are, claim to be only a shadow of the true pinnacle of the Zombie life cycle. These mysterious overlords supposedly command vast armies, have elite Zombies at their disposal, and can project unparalleled psionic force. They are said to dwell even deeper underground than vampires, where the earth and stone themselves crumble under their overwhelming presence... Or so the Queen says.{NEWLINE}While the perspective of actively searching for these mythical beings may be somewhat discouraging, it doesn't look like we have much choice. And despite their immense powers, zombies - including vampires - are rather naive and easily impressed, so maybe it won't be so bad after all?"
  STR_FOLLOW_THE_ZOMBIES: "Follow The Zombies"
  STR_FOLLOW_THE_ZOMBIES_UFOPEDIA: "With Tomb Guard information, we have completed a survey of known Zombie tribes. Some of the tracks led us to hidden caves, reaching deep into the earth. They seem to live there, indifferent to darkness and heat. Judging from our knowledge of Zombie ecology, there could be hordes of them. Apparently our encounters with the Zombies were but the tip of the iceberg.{NEWLINE}Either way, we should start monitoring this underworld. These Zombies could lead us to their masters."
  STR_ZOMBIE_PLOT: "Zombie Plot"
  STR_ZOMBIE_PLOT_UFOPEDIA: "We have established that the so-called Zombie Parasites appear in an area with confirmed alien activity. An alien vessel crew abducts a human, brainwashes them into a hypnotic-like state and hands them several Zombie Parasites to be deployed in the local community. While the hypnosis is temporary, the victim usually ends up as the last host in the batch, which is how secrecy is maintained. Unfortunately we can only speculate about the aliens' true motives."
  STR_SENTIENT_ZOMBIE: "Zombie Consciousness"
  STR_SENTIENT_ZOMBIE_UFOPEDIA: "Our discovery of sentient Zombies - if Tomb Guards can still be called so - has revolutionized our understanding of these creatures, their life cycle and their status as living beings. With extra brain matter, Tomb Guards act almost like humans: they talk, use tools, have some abstract thoughts. However, they are not humans; their selves are smaller, and their alien biology affects their perception of the world. Nevertheless, we should think of them as sentient.{NEWLINE}Yet there is another significant aspect to this Zombie stage: hyperenergetic plasma synthesis. This is what has enabled them to develop so much; they do not have to rely solely on collecting blood plasma, they slowly produce it themselves! And according to their words, there are even more mentally advanced Zombie forms out there - their 'Masters'. These superintelligent Zombies must have even better physiology. Honestly, it's a little scary."
  STR_ZOMBIE_ARE_BREEDING: "'They Are Breeding!' Zombie Report"
  STR_ZOMBIE_ARE_BREEDING_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, the news regarding Zombies multiplying is grim: they not only eat people, but are using them to increase their numbers. This is achieved by Zombies eating each other until they turn into Fat Zombies, which allows them to better regenerate their host and finally mutate into the Infector stage. This could well be the ultimate objective of the 'Zombie evolution': breeding.{NEWLINE}However, something doesn't add up. Zombies thrive on their hyperenergetic chemicals, which is why they eat each other, but they do not produce it; so they will always go extinct in the end. Why bother with reproduction when your population is going to die anyway? If Zombies are a biological weapon, could this be a safety measure against an uncontrolled outbreak, or perhaps a technical limitation that couldn't have been overcome?{NEWLINE}Anyway, we should notify the governments about this issue. This should help contain at least some of the epidemics."
  STR_ZOMBIE_EVOLUTION_HYPOTHESIS: "Zombie Evolution Hypothesis"
  STR_ZOMBIE_EVOLUTION_HYPOTHESIS_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, our analysis of both Zombie variants, the 'regular' and the 'fat', suggests that some sort of evolutionary change is happening within these creatures. I think it is safe to assume that some further stages of this process may exist.{NEWLINE}I will continue my research in this regard, but please understand that in order to do it correctly, I will have to go step-by-step. In other words, if we happen to find several further stages of Zombies, we should examine them in the order of their evolution. I mean, if they really do evolve."
  STR_ZOMBIE_PARASITE: "Zombie Parasite"
  STR_ZOMBIE_PARASITE_UFOPEDIA: "This small organism is ready for insertion into a human being, which would turn them into a Zombie. It is clearly alien in origin."
  STR_DAMAGED_ZOMBIE_PARASITE: "Damaged Zombie Parasite"
  STR_DAMAGED_ZOMBIE_PARASITE_UFOPEDIA: "This Zombie Parasite survived its host, but is badly injured. It is violently flailing its tendrils around, desperately trying to regenerate. It will not succeed, but we can freeze it in its half-dead state and sell it on the Grey Market. Perhaps medical research will unlock its regenerative secrets and some good can come of this evil thing."

  STR_MEGAZOMBIE_TERRORIST: "Megazombie"
  STR_MEGAZOMBIE_CORPSE: "Megazombie Corpse"
  STR_MEGAZOMBIE_AUTOPSY: "Megazombie Autopsy"
  STR_MEGAZOMBIE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Zombie variant was artificially created by overfeeding a Fat Zombie while preventing it from turning into an Infector. As a result, all the excess energy was redirected into body mass, creating an unusually large and strong Fat Zombie. Its body contains additional energy reserves, giving it enormous vitality."
  STR_MEGAZOMBIE_UFOPEDIA: "The Megazombie possesses no new special characteristics over its baseline variant, the Fat Zombie. However, its enormous resilience and relatively good speed make it a dangerous enemy. Upon encountering one, the suggested course of action is to saturate the target with hi-yield explosives or incendiary weapons; like with all Zombies, energy weapons are not very efficient."

  STR_ZOMBIE_TROOPER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Zombie was fitted with modern combat armor and special cybernetic implants wired up to the remains of its nervous system as well as the parasite itself. Otherwise it appears to be a regular, well-fed Zombie."
  STR_ZOMBIE_TROOPER_UFOPEDIA: "This monstrosity is clearly a result of scientific experimentation on a regular Zombie. Curiously, it is able to use objects like weapons and other military equipment, at the same time failing to understand much simpler mechanisms. It can safely be assumed that it was programmed for some specific tasks, most likely via a cybernetic implant we found in its brain."
  STR_ZOMBIE_IMPLANT_VIRUS: "Zombie Implant Virus"
  STR_ZOMBIE_IMPLANT_VIRUS_UFOPEDIA: "We finally have all the pieces necessary to solve this case. It turns out that the Syndicate, being M.A.G.M.A.'s declared rival, used Osiron to strike a deal with Cyberweb to produce a computer virus designed to disrupt the function of M.A.G.M.A.'s Zombie Implants. This virus was then planted in some M.A.G.M.A. laboratories and started slowly infecting the implants in captive Zombies, one by one. The process was slow and erratic, which contributed to the difficulty of isolating the problem. Also, the ingenuity of the design of this virus prevented M.A.G.M.A. specialists from noticing anything.{NEWLINE}After all this, M.A.G.M.A. will certainly show us some gratitude. We should await their response."
  STR_ZOMBIE_IMPLANT_INVESTIGATION: "Zombie Implant Investigation"
  STR_ZOMBIE_IMPLANT_INVESTIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "The detained Osiron leader has provided us with some very interesting information regarding the M.A.G.M.A. zombie implant. Apparently, the group which sought to create such a tool is none other than the mysterious Syndicate, an international shadow corporation that dominates over most organized crime around the world. The service was provided by another rogue group, the Cyberweb.{NEWLINE}Why would this Syndicate want to sabotage M.A.G.M.A. research? First of all, they are long-term competitors, and on very bad terms. But my instincts tell me there is some deeper conflict here.{NEWLINE}For now we must find and arrest some Syndicate personnel. Hopefully we'll learn more then."
  STR_ZOMBIE_IMPLANT_ORIGINS: "Zombie Implant Origins"
  STR_ZOMBIE_IMPLANT_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "Information from the EXALT Master allowed us to proceed with our investigation of the Zombie Trooper cerebral implant. Some unidentified person contacted the deep criminal underground last year with a very special request: to create a computer virus meant to infect psionic devices. This person struck some kind of deal with a group named Osiron, which claimed to know just the right people for this. Our further investigation confirmed this, and also suggested that the device to be infected could be the Zombie implant.{NEWLINE}We need to check if any of our previous investigations gave us any leads. If yes, good. If not, our next step is to locate these Osiron people and ask them nicely about their mysterious client, and their provider. I'm sure M.A.G.M.A. will be very interested in obtaining this information. For this mission, we will have to use a civilian vehicle and concealable equipment."
  STR_ZOMBIE_IMPLANT: "Zombie Trooper Implant"
  STR_ZOMBIE_IMPLANT_UFOPEDIA: "This is a special cybernetic implant connected to the brain. It allows Zombie Troopers to perform certain complex tasks like using ranged weapons, albeit not very efficiently. The implant appears to be similar in function to Psiclone, so it can be assumed to have been designed as a mind control device to affect the Zombie's behavior. It doesn't seem to be working correctly though, as the Zombie Trooper does not respond well to any kind of implant stimulation."
  STR_ZOMBIE_INFECTOR_ARMOR: "Zombie Infector Combat Analysis"
  STR_ZOMBIE_INFECTOR: "Zombie Infector"
  STR_ZOMBIE_INFECTOR_CORPSE: "Zombie Infector Corpse"
  STR_ZOMBIE_INFECTOR_UFOPEDIA: "Infectors are Fat Zombies who have, through an energy-rich diet consisting of other Zombies, undergone a significant physiological transformation. They are much faster and better coordinated than their brethren and thus pose a greater risk. The parasite uses its new high-energy environment to multiply and the resultant offspring is implanted into living people, turning them into basic Zombies. Its life span is also much longer, partially due to better metabolism."
  STR_ZOMBIE_INFECTOR_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Zombie has well-developed muscle tissue, cardiovascular and nervous systems. Most of the cells seem young, as if they were grown very recently. The parasite has also undergone some curious physiological changes related to reproduction."

  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS: "Fat Zombie"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_CORPSE: "Fat Zombie Corpse"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_UFOPEDIA: "Fat Zombies are abnormal Zombies that prey on their regular brethren. Since all Zombies contain parasites which are powered with hyperenergetic chemicals, a freshly fed Fat Zombie has twice as much energy at its disposal. This excess energy enables a number of physiological changes, leading to better metabolic efficiency and a longer life span. Its grayish skin is a good indicator of how deeply these changes go: biochemically, this being no longer resembles humans at all."
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_AUTOPSY: "Fat Zombie Autopsy"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Zombie is particularly large and heavy. Its biochemistry is drastically different from that of a regular Zombie and contains more high-energy compounds. Inside its digestive tract we have found the remains of another Zombie."

  STR_ZOMBIE_BOOMER_CORPSE: "Zombie Boomer Corpse"
  STR_ZOMBIE_BOOMER_TERRORIST: "Zombie Boomer"
  STR_ZOMBIE_BOOMER_UFOPEDIA: "Due to an aberrant metabolism, these Zombies fail to properly process highly energetic compounds gained from eating other Zombies, which start accumulating in their bodies like tumors. Due to reduced weight, they move much faster, but these pitiful creations only live for a few hours. When mortally wounded, the parasite inside them loses any control over the host's physiology and all this stored energy is expended at once, creating a powerful explosion which tears the Zombie apart. With some research we may be able to utilize these tumors as energy sources, if salvaged pre-detonation."
  STR_ZOMBIE_BOOMER_AUTOPSY: "Zombie Boomer Autopsy"
  STR_ZOMBIE_BOOMER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Lab Technician Vuorela drew the short straw to conduct the autopsy, which took place in a secured vault usually used for high explosive research. It was discovered that the original hypothesis was correct: inside this degenerate Fat Zombie there are many pockets filled with volatile and unstable chemicals. These pockets have proven salvageable and make an effective, if slightly disturbing weapon. Note: Do not allow the dogs to chew on salvaged organs."

  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_TERRORIST: "Zombie"
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_UFOPEDIA: "These infected humans have been completely overtaken by an alien parasite. They possess little cognitive capabilities and show no higher brain functions; in fact, their brains are mostly consumed by the parasite. They have poor motor skills and reactions to stimuli, but are completely immune to pain. Zombies are incapable of using tools unless directly handed an object, which they will then use as a clubbing instrument. Even though Zombies retain their original bodies, they can no longer be considered human and have very a short life span due to their deteriorated metabolism. We keep them in cages rather than prison cells."
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_AUTOPSY: "Zombie Autopsy"
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature was definitely human once, but its central nervous system was overtaken by a parasite of unknown origin. The parasite is pea-sized, with very long appendages that reach into various organs. It seems unrelated to any known modern or ancient organisms. Its effect on the host's body is a complete override of basic metabolism, giving it great resilience and immunity to pain, but at the cost of imminent death."

  STR_ZOMBIE_INFECTOR_WEAPON: "Zombie Infector's Bite"
  STR_ZOMBIE_INFECTOR_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "Zombie Infector's bite implants an egg from the Parasite, which instantly takes over the new host - forever."

  STR_SWARMIDS_AUTOPSY: "Swarmids Autopsy"
  STR_SWARMIDS_UFOPEDIA: "Swarmids are unlike any other creature known to science. They aggressively search for prey, spotting them using their well developed multi-ocular structure. The eyes can work independently so the creature can see reasonably well unless all of them are damaged. Their stinger is very robust; it has difficulties penetrating heavy armor directly, but they instinctively seek out weak spots, leaving pheromones as a signal to the rest of the swarm. Conventional projectile-based weapons are of little use, only explosions and especially fire can damage them consistently."
  STR_SWARMIDS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The body of this insectoid creature comprises a slightly armored torso and a flexible tail. The torso hosts a slot containing multiple articulated eyes and is surmounted by three pairs of wings. The tail is wholly muscle tissue, similar to the human tongue, and it ends with a fearsome stinger used for attacking prey."

  STR_CHIEF_MEDICAL_OFFICER_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Hello, Commander, I am the chief Medical Officer at this base. I heard some good stuff about you, so I have high hopes for the project.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}As you know, my duty is to keep our field agents in one piece after... well, you know how it is with shady businesses like ours. However, I am also qualified to perform scientific analyses on any biological materials of interest, including autopsies, vivisections and biochemical tests. Feel free to pay me a visit when you feel like it. Sorry for the smell of antiseptics, but believe me, it's better this way."
  STR_INTELLIGENCE_OFFICER_INTRODUCTION: "Intelligence Officer Introduction"
  STR_INTELLIGENCE_OFFICER_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Great to see you, Commander; nice suit, too! I am the Intelligence Officer here, which means I take phone calls, make coffee and squeeze people for information. I think that last thing would be most important to you, but my hot coffee is really good, too!{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Anyway, our situation is simple: we're in pitch black. I have little to no leads to follow at the moment, so we have to find these first. The best source of intel are live captives, I mean arrested individuals, so please tell the field agents to leave at least some for me. There are other sources too, like captured documents and such, so keep an eye on anything that looks unusual. Just please don't give me dead bodies, they're not very talkative; if you think they're really interesting, talk to that hot Chief Medical Officer instead, she's competent and knows what good coffee is."
  STR_CHIEF_ACCOUNTANT_INTRODUCTION: "Chief Accountant Introduction"
  STR_CHIEF_ACCOUNTANT_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Ah, it's you, Commander. I am the Chief Accountant here, which means I'm responsible for all money transfers you authorize, so you'd better keep your spending urges in check.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}So, you will be the one in charge of this mess. I really hope you're up for the job, because it doesn't look that good. You know as well as me that we're just a side operation to show how much the UN cares about all this weird crap. But whatever your standing on it is, I am going to keep this project running and I assure you, I'll be here at least as long as you!"
  STR_QUARTERMASTER_INTRODUCTION: "Quartermaster Introduction"
  STR_QUARTERMASTER_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Hello, Commander. I am the Quartermaster here, at your service.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}I will keep an eye on all supply orders so that our agents don't have to. As it is, we seem to be a bit underequipped, so I'll try and fix something a little more advanced for us if you let me. If you need anything special, just let me know and I'll see what can be done.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}For starters, I would recommend expanding our basic field gear a little. They say some of our suspects are... well, harder to take down than usual, if you know what I mean, and my instinct tells me shootings will be common."
  STR_LOGISTICS: "Logistics"
  STR_LOGISTICS_UFOPEDIA: "Our so-called 'global logistics network' is fiction: in theory we can get anywhere, but getting there with a decent equipment AND on time would be a goddamn miracle! Nobody likes foreign agents on their soil, and four is worse than two.{NEWLINE}Nevertheless, by threatening the right people I managed to improve the system a bit, so now we can actually get a van ready in every major city on the planet, theoretically. If you think it is unimpressive, you are welcome to not use it and stop wasting my time."
  STR_PERSONAL_PROTECTION: "Personal Protection"
  STR_PERSONAL_PROTECTION_UFOPEDIA: "Kevlar vests are hardly cutting-edge technology, but apparently we were not considered important enough for a steady supply of those. I hope to correct this apparent error, even though it'll be a lot paperwork on my part. They're somewhat expensive for what little protection they offer, but maybe at least they'll make our agents happier.{NEWLINE}For now, how about using good old leather coats? At least they'll keep you waterproof and might stop a weak attack."
  STR_NONSTANDARD_WEAPONS: "Non-Standard Weapons"
  STR_NONSTANDARD_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "With all the paperwork done - and it really was a lot - we have finally secured a supplier of weapons that were previously deemed 'unnecessary' for our operations. Nothing out of depth really, just some additional models that would match some of our men better than what we have, like those really big Magnum revolvers or maybe Shotguns when we grow bigger. If you need any, just order them as normal."
  STR_MEDICINE: "Medicine"
  STR_MEDICINE_UFOPEDIA: "Let us start with the basics: before making any substantial discoveries, we must squeeze what we can from available sources. After all, we are not paid to reinvent the wheel. Our aim should be to contact the right people and either request or buy what we need to make what we don't have.{NEWLINE}For starters, I would like to suggest getting acquainted with someone who deals with experimental stem cell therapies, since I believe this technology is something that can save the lives of our agents. I can look into that if you give me some time.{NEWLINE}I do, however, have access to a range of non-conventional specifics which can potentially enhance our agents' fighting capabilities. It takes much time and training, but our agents will gradually rise above ordinary men. You want to know where I got it from? Oh, I assure you, soon you will stop being surprised by such trivialities."

  STR_XENOLOGIST_CONTACT_UFOPEDIA: "Ah, greetings, greetings! I am absolutely exhilarated to be your Chief Xenologist. You seem to be a good leader, Commander; I'm expecting a lot from this operation.{NEWLINE}I can see you're not exactly sure why I'm here, correct? Well, neither am I, to be honest. It doesn't look like there's anything going on where my unique skills would be applicable. But don't worry, I'm sure your Intelligence Officer or Chief Engineer or whoever else is conducting research here will seek my help very soon. I'm sure you won't regret inviting me here, Commander... And I'm sure I won't regret it either."
  STR_MILITARY_ENVOY_CONTACT: "Military Envoy Recruitment"
  STR_MILITARY_ENVOY_CONTACT_UFOPEDIA: "Greetings, Comm'der! Your new Military Envoy here. I was sent here on the double, regarding some sort of alien troublemakers. No need to ask how I know that, I have my connections. That's why you wanted me, right?{NEWLINE}Anyway, I already had a talk with one of your agents, the one that brought me here, and apparently we are sorely underequipped. I can't promise you any nukes at this point, but I think I can get you something extra through my old friends. What do you mean by 'is it legal', of course it's legal! If we could use illegal stuff unpunished, things would be way easier. Er, of course I wouldn't be able to help you with that anyway, Comm'der."
  STR_CHIEF_RESEARCHER_CONTACT: "Chief Researcher Recruitment"
  STR_CHIEF_RESEARCHER_CONTACT_UFOPEDIA: "Good evening, Commander. I have received your offer to become Chief Researcher and it certainly stirred my interest. I must say I was skeptical at first, but some well-placed colleagues assured me that you have good evidence about these strange events, so I couldn't resist coming here to see it for myself.{NEWLINE}Frankly, our research facilities are rather modest, but they will have to do for now. If you don't mind, I'll have a meeting with your staff immediately to discuss improvements to the labs. I mean, right after I move in. We do have a double suite, don't we?"
  STR_CHIEF_ENGINEER_CONTACT: "Chief Engineer Recruitment"
  STR_CHIEF_ENGINEER_CONTACT_UFOPEDIA: "Hi, pal. I got your message, so here I am: your new Chief Engineer.{NEWLINE}Look, I'm here just for the gadgets, okay? I'm not much of a politician and I don't know if your three-ringed circus is a better thing for the world than the other three-ringed circuses; I don't really care. But I'll give you a hand as long as you keep the cool stuff coming.{NEWLINE}So, where's my workshop? WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE DON'T HAVE ONE? Geez, looks like my work has already started. We really need to design some working space, with decent equipment and plenty of room and a computer with cool vocalization system. You know what, just let me get to work and I'll bring you the blueprints when they're ready."
  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft are constructed from special alloys with unique properties, placing them in the 'Tritanium' class of materials, previously thought to be only theoretical. They are extremely light and durable, and can be molded by electro-magnetic methods. When desired, they can exhibit shape memory and superelasticity effects while being more durable than any other material known to science - basically a a self-healing superalloy. This material can be used in many kinds of manufacturing processes."
  STR_ALLOYS_ENGINEERING: "Alien Alloys Engineering"
  STR_ALLOYS_ENGINEERING_UFOPEDIA: "Alien Alloys by themselves are fantastic, but they are so different from our materials that figuring out their exact physical properties, and how to introduce them into the alloy sheet, took me a night or two. But now that we have left these obstacles behind, let's put this new technology to good use! Hmmm, how about some improvements to our firearms? Just saying!"
  STR_ALIEN_ENGINEERING: "Alien Engineering"
  STR_ALIEN_ENGINEERING_UFOPEDIA: "Alien devices used by humans such as cultists are made with widely available electronics, but according to rules and logic that are very different from what we're used to. Nevertheless, such devices obey all known laws of physics and operate on principles that begin to make sense once you are familiar with them. Now we understand these components well enough to tinker with them and learn more about their functions."
  STR_ALIEN_LANGUAGE: "Alien Language"
  STR_ALIEN_LANGUAGE_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens employ a form of written language to communicate with their followers. This language uses alien symbols arranged in accordance to a simple grammar system to form short messages. At this point we cannot say whether the aliens use this language to communicate between each other as well, but perhaps we can learn more about their relationship with humans."
  STR_UFO_SIGNATURE: "UFO Signature"
  STR_UFO_SIGNATURE_UFOPEDIA: "We have determined that the alien communicator works by identifying and locating UFO transmissions, which the aliens normally hide from our sensors with sophisticated technology.

  STR_ALIEN_COMMUNICATOR: "Alien Communicator"
  STR_ALIEN_COMMUNICATOR_UFOPEDIA: "This device is used by high-ranking cultists to contact their alien masters. It is built according to an Alien design, but with Earth materials. It transmits a simple two-way digital signal between the user and a nearby UFO, allowing them to send messages in an alien language.{NEWLINE}The most interesting thing about this communicator is that it is equipped with a short-range UFO detector.

  STR_ZSRR_RED_OPS: "Red Ops"
  STR_ZSRR_RED_OPS_UFOPEDIA: "Red Ops is a military formation of elite Red Dawn soldiers with significant combat experience. These people are both very capable and very well equipped, which makes them extremely dangerous in combat. They are normally used for special assignments whenever intense combat is expected, but fortunately their limited numbers prevent them from being fielded too often. Like other Red Dawn members, they are biologically enhanced to increase their physical characteristics."
  STR_ZSRR_MOLOLEC: "Red Dawn Lad"
  STR_ZSRR_MOLOLEC_UFOPEDIA: "A Lad, or 'Molodets', is a common name for a Red Dawn soldier. These individuals have solid military training and excellent physical characteristics, thanks to the enhancement process. While not particularly well-informed, 'Lads' are reasonably competent and widely used for protecting Red Dawn infrastructure, doing mercenary work and performing terror raids. They commonly use military weapons."
  STR_ZSRR_GANGER: "Red Dawn Ganger"
  STR_ZSRR_GANGER_UFOPEDIA: "Gangers are the lowest-ranking members of Red Dawn. While not particularly well-trained, they have excellent reflexes, strength and stamina, which upon further investigation proves to be due to artificial enhancement. In exchange for their services, gangers are promised physical might and a share of 'the spoils of war', whatever that is. Gangers generally operate in cities and are easy to mistake for common thugs, but they are usually supervised by more knowledgeable and better-equipped Red Dawn members."

Red Dawn members are biologically augmented for better combat capabilities, which indicates a human enhancement project on an unprecedented scale. Most Red Dawn activities are related to organized crime and mercenary services, which they use to gather more money and power.

  STR_BASEBALL_BAT: "Baseball Bat"

They are recruited from various countries and social groups and still live their normal lives as not to expose their cover, but resemble monks more than ordinary citizens. Apart from many poetical forms of worship they possess little useful information, but their devotion to the Black Lotus is more than enough reason to apprehend them."

They reside in Black Lotus estates, training rigorously and participating in mystic rituals. They possess a unique and mysterious ability to blend in with their surroundings completely, unless seen from up close. Assassins themselves cannot explain this ability other than as an ancient art that takes many years to master, but our tests point to a mental effect rather than true invisibility. In combat, Assassins use silent weapons like swords or thrown blades."

It had all teeth, soft feet soles, everything to prove it was both extremely young and completely perfect.

The Church has maintained its presence in Europe and Africa for many decades and is quite influential, though real cultists have trouble interacting with normal humans due to physical and psychosocial changes caused by the cult's practices."
  STR_BLACK_LOTUS_PSI_GENERATOR: "Black Lotus Psi Generator"
  STR_BLACK_LOTUS_PSI_GENERATOR_UFOPEDIA: "This strange device was installed within the Avatar statue of the Black Lotus main base. Its purpose is to receive and amplify psionic waves coming from some location in outer space and enable the 'possession' of humans by the cult's 'goddess'.{NEWLINE}While we cannot say we truly understand its principles of operation, we can theoretically use it to locate such psionic wavefronts. If we manage to do so, this will effectively disable the Black Lotus as an organization, since they will not be able to contact their mistress without us knowing about it immediately."
  STR_DESTROY_EXALT: "Terminate EXALT!"
  STR_DESTROY_EXALT_UFOPEDIA: "Our operation is a success! With the right settings, we managed to make Psiclone addicts even more addicted, so now they favor our stuff over alien stuff and refuse their orders. It may be morally ambiguous, but it certainly helped contain a great danger to humanity. EXALT's Masters are now pretty much alone except for their most faithful servants and shouldn't give us any further trouble.{NEWLINE}Since we're done with them, we should now move on to the next level: the hybrids."
  STR_DESTROY_BLACK_LOTUS: "Terminate The Black Lotus!"
  STR_DESTROY_BLACK_LOTUS_UFOPEDIA: "We have completed the construction of our psi detector using the Black Lotus psi generator as a base. Now they cannot hide from us! In fact, we located some of their leaders within mere hours of activating the detector and dispatched teams to storm their hideouts. The Black Lotus is no more, their remaining forces scattered and clueless.{NEWLINE}We don't need to keep any extra psi generators, as they are useless to us now. I suggest we sell them or something."
  STR_DAGON_STATUE: "Church of Dagon Statue"
  STR_DAGON_STATUE_UFOPEDIA: "This statue is made of some unearthly material and is extremely hard to damage with saws, lasers or chemical torches. Once we finally managed to open it, we found a lot of texts written in the Eldritch Language concerning the Church, its general operations, orders received from Dagon and so on. This information is enough to target the crucial nodes of the cult with support from national governments. If you wish us to release this intel and be done with them, just say the word - it won't take long."
  STR_DESTROY_CHURCH_OF_DAGON: "Terminate The Church of Dagon!"
  STR_DESTROY_CHURCH_OF_DAGON_UFOPEDIA: "So it is done, Commander - the Church of Dagon is beaten. It still exists, but was forced into hiding and we're unlikely to ever hear about them again. I can't say I'll miss them much.{NEWLINE}If you happen to have any Dagon statues left, I suggest we throw them away. They creep me out, you know?"
  STR_RED_DAWN_KEYCARD: "Red Dawn Memory Card"
  STR_RED_DAWN_KEYCARD_UFOPEDIA: "We have successfully decoded the memory card. All of the Red Dawn's secrets, including names, addresses, logbooks, expenses, contacts, aliases, estates - we have it all, Commander. Their future is in your hands.{NEWLINE}I have the data ready for disclosure to the right people. If this is done, the Red Dawn is finished. But ultimately it's your call if, and when, we want to do this. I will support your every decision.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}- Chief Intelligence Officer"
  STR_DESTROY_ZSRR: "Terminate The Red Dawn!"
  STR_DESTROY_ZSRR_UFOPEDIA: "Job done, Commander - we have informed the United Nations and the president of Russia of the complete Red Dawn agenda and all associated details. This will be more than enough to get all of their commanding officers sentenced to a long time in prison, or worse. I wish we could see their faces now!{NEWLINE}Now we can concentrate on the really important things! And we can also sell any Red Dawn Keycards we may have, we don't need them anymore."
  STR_SKULLJACK: "Skulljack"
  STR_SKULLJACK_UFOPEDIA: "By connecting a Psiclone to an agent's brain implant, we have managed to turn a two-way feedback device into a three-way one, creating a psi channel between the agent's and target's mind. This allows us to tamper with the target's thought processes and perception, effectively allowing the agent to take temporary control over the target's actions. Beware: this is a fairly tiring process, and potentially dangerous to the user's integrity in the long term.{NEWLINE}>Concealable"
  STR_PSICLONE: "Psiclone"
  STR_PSICLONE_UFOPEDIA: "This strange device has an extremely potent psychoactive effect. Our studies of its users indicate that it significantly improves their reflexes and morale, but also severely alters the victim's mind, making them experience complex hallucinations. Actually, the EXALT members claim these hallucinations are in fact visions caused by genuine psychic activity, since the device heightens one's psionic perception and enables a human to 'tune in' to these alien signals, albeit erratically.{NEWLINE}>Concealable"
  STR_XCOM_PSICLONE: "X-Com Psiclone"
  STR_XCOM_PSICLONE_UFOPEDIA: "This device is an EXALT Psiclone converted for use by X-Com agents. In order to use it, you must stand next to the target and then choose the action from the menu:{NEWLINE}PANIC UNIT> If the attack is successful it will reduce the target's morale and may cause it to panic.{NEWLINE}>Concealable"
  STR_EXALT: "EXALT"
  STR_EXALT_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}EXALT is a clandestine organization, mostly active in the Americas. It was founded by a group of powerful individuals with political connections and it appears to have a hand in various criminal activities, like illegal drug distribution. Their signature trading goods are mental devices called Psiclones, rumored to be highly psychoactive. There is little doubt that such devices have extraterrestrial origins and are probably highly dangerous."

  STR_EXALT_INFILTRATOR: "EXALT Infiltrator"
  STR_EXALT_INFILTRATOR_UFOPEDIA: "These citizens are the EXALT organization's low-level agents. Most of them resume their daily lives as normal, silently waiting for orders from the top. Others are tasked with distribution of the Psiclone superdrug, and a small number is actually participating in terror attacks. Did I mention they are all heavily addicted to the Psiclone? Yeah, I guess now you know why they're so devoted to the organization."
  STR_EXALT_GOON: "EXALT Goon"
  STR_EXALT_GOON_UFOPEDIA: "These people are career footsoldiers of EXALT. They are well-trained, determined and extremely hard to overcome mentally. Their physical abilities are exceptional, too."
  STR_EXALT_ENFORCER: "EXALT Enforcer"
  STR_EXALT_ENFORCER_UFOPEDIA: "Enforcers are EXALT officers, often in charge of minor operations. They are ruthlessly efficient and should not be taken lightly."
  STR_EXALT_BRAINER: "EXALT Brainer"
  STR_EXALT_BRAINER_UFOPEDIA: "Considering that the rank-and-file members of EXALT are mostly controlled with Psiclone distribution, there is a way to win without a prolonged war: use this EXALT weapon against them. We can now understand how the Psiclone works well enough to develop a counter-wave that will disrupt the functioning of these devices over large swathes of land. Before our enemies adjust their signal, we will flood the market with our cracked Psiclones which will be just as good but functioning and, you know, not forcing you into an alien army in exchange. This should render EXALT harmless enough for us to no longer care about it. Just give the order, Commander."
  STR_EXALT_BRAINER_CORPSE: "Brainer Corpse"
  STR_HYBRID_BRAINER: "Hybrid Brainer"
  STR_BRAINER: "Brainer Hybrid"
  STR_BRAINER_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is half-human, half-alien. It possesses unusual mental capabilities, including telekinesis and a personal force field. It was reportedly bred by E.T.s to infiltrate the Earth. It holds an important position in a network of his brethren, more human-looking but equally dangerous."
  STR_BRAINER_AUTOPSY: "Brainer Autopsy"
  STR_BRAINER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature's physiology is mostly human, as it shares all of our organs except the genitalia which it never had. The brain however is more developed and atypical in some ways, which suggests better mental capacity. Physically, it is extremely fragile, but battle reports suggest that there is some kind of force field around the creature."
  STR_EXALT_LIQUIDATOR: "EXALT Liquidator"
  STR_EXALT_LIQUIDATOR_UFOPEDIA: "Liquidators are elite EXALT agents, serving in the special forces of their overlords - usually to spread terror. They are well-trained, equipped with good body armor and completely devoted to their cause... or to their Psiclones."
  STR_TERROR_FROM_THE_DEEP: "Terror from The Deep"
  STR_TERROR_FROM_THE_DEEP_UFOPEDIA: "We have finally uncovered the terrible plan of T'leth: it appears it is building an army of unstoppable warriors named Tasoths to overrun Earth.{NEWLINE}Luckily for us, this army is being produced in an isolated facility, as the process requires machinery that is quite volatile. This gives us a chance to infiltrate it. We should obtain enough data to devise a plan to disable it as soon as possible."
  STR_ZRBITE_TANK: "Zrbite Tank"
  STR_ZRBITE_TANK_UFOPEDIA: "This alien device contains an exotic, highly energetic material called Zrbite."
  STR_ZRBITE_TANK_DISASSEMBLY: "Zrbite Tank Disassembly"
  STR_ZRBITE: "Zrbite"
  STR_ZRBITE_UFOPEDIA: "This is an alloy of alien origin, part gold, part biomaterial. It is a very efficient power source, used for alien weapons and ships. It is stored in special crystal tanks with a capacity of 30 units.{NEWLINE}Sadly, it is beyond our technical ability to replicate this material as most of its constituents are Alien in origin. Again."
  STR_AQUA_PLASTICS: "Aqua Plastics"
  STR_AQUA_PLASTICS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien submarines and structures utilize an incredibly strong, flexible and durable material for the majority of their construction. Aqua Plastics are complex multi-bonded and Zrbite catalyzed materials. Dense, yet light, the substance has strength above even Titanium or Kevlar. Unfortunately, its manufacturing process is mostly organic, so we do not have the infrastructure to produce it."
  STR_JANISSARY_ARMOR: "Gillman Combat Analysis"
  STR_JANISSARY_WEAPON: "Gillman Attack"
  STR_JANISSARY: "Gillman"
  STR_JANISSARY_AUTOPSY: "Gillman Autopsy"
  STR_JANISSARY_UFOPEDIA: "Despite having been human once, the Gillmen are unaware of their previous identity and under complete control of the aliens. There is no way of communicating with them, since they are controlled directly through cybernetic implants in their heavily modified brains. In battle, they use no weapons; they kill or incapacitate with an electric discharge. They are normally tasked with guard duties."
  STR_JANISSARY_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "These creatures are a horrifying result of human experimentation. They are created from captured victims, heavily modified with cybernetics and biotechnology. The most noticeable cybernetic modifications are related to the brain and cardiovascular system, there is also some sort of lightning generator built into each of their arms. Their physiology is clearly designed to enable them to work underwater indefinitely, and at great depths."
  STR_JANISSARY_TERRORIST: "Gillman Terrorist"
  STR_JANISSARY_CORPSE: "Gillman Corpse"

  STR_GILLDOG_CORPSE: "Gilldog Corpse"
  STR_GILLDOG_AUTOPSY: "Gilldog Autopsy"
  STR_GILLDOG_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Our agents were correct in their assessment of this creature: it really has both lungs and gills. Its scaly hide gives it protection against most forms of damage, especially chemical, and its body structure can withstand great pressures like ocean depths or explosions. The jaws are powerful and extremely nasty."
  STR_GILLDOG_UFOPEDIA: "Gilldogs can operate both on land and underwater. They are dangerous predators, combining mammalian intelligence with ichthyic tenacity. Their primary weakness is smoke, which tends to easily suffocate them."
  STR_GILLDOG_WEAPON: "Gilldog Bite"

  STR_BLOODHOUND_CORPSE: "Bloodhound Corpse"
  STR_BLOODHOUND_AUTOPSY: "Bloodhound Autopsy"
  STR_BLOODHOUND_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This nightmarish creature is a large canine that underwent genetic engineering and surgical enhancement. It possesses great muscle strength, especially in the jaw area. The cranium is thick and sturdy. The creature has been fed a cocktail of antibiotics, which suggests an immune system deficiency. The secret to its uncanny resilience to gunfire lies inside its horribly mutilated, tough skin: a lattice of Durathread, apparently implanted after the creature was full-grown. Most worrying, still is the presence of a tattooed barcode with a serial number."
  STR_BLOODHOUND_UFOPEDIA: "These monstrous, genetically engineered canines are mass-produced beasts of war. They're savage and bloodthirsty, yet no less smart and loyal than normal dogs. They're implanted with a Durathread skin graft, making them very resistant to bullets. Their only weakness is complete reliance on expensive drugs and antibiotics to stay alive, due to imperfections in the design. They're also sterile. However, their manufacturers consider both of these features advantageous in such a prospective commercial product."
  STR_BLOODHOUND_WEAPON: "Bloodhound Bite"

  STR_SORCERER_OF_DAGON_ARMOR: "Sorcerer of Dagon Combat Analysis"
  STR_SUPPORTER_OF_DAGON: "Supporter of Dagon"
  STR_SUPPORTER_OF_DAGON_UFOPEDIA: "These individuals are initiate members of a quasi-religious organization called the Church of Dagon. They speak of secret rituals involving human sacrifices, meant to gain favors from ocean deities, but otherwise live normal lives. They are mostly just civilians, but crazy, armed and dangerous."
  STR_DISCIPLE_OF_DAGON: "Disciple of Dagon"
  STR_DISCIPLE_OF_DAGON_UFOPEDIA: "These low-ranking cultists claim to be in service of a supernatural entity called Dagon, associated with ocean depths. They seem to be affected by a common syndrome that makes their skin appear grayish and wet, as well as causing some abnormalities in development. This syndrome stunts their intellectual capabilities but makes them more resistant to pain and shock, as well as gives them better low-light vision. Their fanatical devotion also makes them almost fearless in combat."
  STR_PRIEST_OF_DAGON: "Priest of Dagon"
  STR_PRIEST_OF_DAGON_UFOPEDIA: "Priests are the leaders of the Church of Dagon. On the outside, they are less affected by the 'Dagon syndrome', which makes them responsible for contacts with outsiders. They are, however, exceptionally tough for human beings and their minds work significantly different from ours, most likely as a result of indoctrination by some alien intelligence, or perhaps a variation of the Dagon syndrome. Priests are crucial to the Church of Dagon and should be apprehended without delay."
  STR_CHOSEN_OF_DAGON: "Chosen of Dagon"
  STR_CHOSEN_OF_DAGON_UFOPEDIA: "This member of the Church of Dagon is similar in appearance to the Disciples of Dagon, but retains significantly more intelligence and even charisma. In captivity, the so-called Chosen spends most of his time in a meditative trance. This trance causes small changes in his body, like finger webbing or scale-like growths on his skin, which recede soon after the trance is broken. Chosen seem to have no special role in the cult other than being examples to follow and are considered enlightened mystics by their brethren."
  STR_DAGON_MORPH: "Dagon Morph"
  STR_DAGON_MORPH_UFOPEDIA: "This creature used to be human, but now is almost completely alien, physically and mentally. His 'Dagon syndrome' has developed fully, transforming him into a semi-aquatic being with frightening psi powers."
  STR_SORCERER_OF_DAGON_CORPSE: "Dagon Morph Corpse"
  STR_SORCERER_OF_DAGON: "Sorcerer of Dagon"
  STR_SORCERER_OF_DAGON_UFOPEDIA: "Sorcerers have the privilege of contacting 'Messengers of Dagon' and claim to travel to their underwater temples. They possess strange telepathic powers that can also be focused through a special device to produce various effects. These abilities make them very dangerous opponents. Sorcerers cannot speak human languages very well, but their followers are guided via telepathy and are quick to follow orders."
  STR_SORCERER_OF_DAGON_AUTOPSY: "Dagon Morph Autopsy"
  STR_SORCERER_OF_DAGON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This being used to be human, but has been extensively modified with unearthly technology down to its genetic code and resulting biochemistry. Its horrifying appearance aside, most of the changes serve to adapt the creature to living underwater. It seems susceptible to fire and should have some trouble breathing air."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_OUTPOST: "Deep One Outposts"
  STR_DEEP_ONE_OUTPOST_UFOPEDIA: "Deep Ones are a nomadic people without any permanent dwellings - they prefer to float around freely, carrying all their possessions with them. Since they rely on supplies from their mysterious 'gods', they generally keep close to unmanned undersea communication outposts. If we find such an outpost, we should monitor it for Deep One activity and intercept any groups that come nearby."
  STR_CALL_OF_TLETH: "Call of T'leth"
  STR_CALL_OF_TLETH_UFOPEDIA: "Whenever Deep Ones need anything, they go to the nearest outpost and call for help. We now understand how their communication device works. If we send a false supply request, their superiors should show up - only to be captured."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_COMMUNITIES: "Deep One Communities"
  STR_DEEP_ONE_COMMUNITIES_UFOPEDIA: "Deep Ones live in small nomadic communities on the continental shelf, hunting for fish and training themselves to be warriors under the tutelage of, for lack of a better word, the priesthood. To sum it up, they are intelligent, but very primitive.{NEWLINE}Our captives were unable to explain where exactly their unusually advanced equipment comes from, only that it was donated by some enigmatic 'masters'. Apparently, whenever we make some discovery, it only shows us that there's a man behind the man. Doesn't it, Commander?"
  STR_EXALT_RATIONALE: "EXALT Rationale"
  STR_EXALT_RATIONALE_UFOPEDIA: "Turns out that EXALT is not a monolithic group. Some of their elites believe that the aliens are in fact a lesser evil when compared with Earth governments, which are ineffectual and corrupted by false ideologies. Other see them simply as a source of profit, much like any other government. They do not perceive this pluralism as a threat, but rather as an internal discourse which does not reflect on the organization's efficiency and is only a healthy competition between different policies - a political darwinism of sorts. Part fringe, part corporate, they are nonetheless well-armed and determined to serve their future alien masters."
  STR_ZSRR_RATIONALE: "Red Dawn Rationale"
  STR_ZSRR_RATIONALE_UFOPEDIA: "Composed mostly of former Soviet officials dissatisfied with the new order of things, Red Dawn runs on an efficient mix of ideology and pragmatism. They consider the alien society - or at least what they know about it from evidence recovered from old USSR warehouses - to be superior in terms of technology, and arguably also morality. Their goal is to survive the inevitable alien conquest and possibly even profit from it. They consider the aliens not much different from us, and that we should become more like them to better fit within the alien empire. They also believe that the aliens must have some sort of internal discourse, and that they can be influenced from within by means of classical politics. Much of their effort is focused on gathering resources for future negotiations with the invaders, after we join them."
  STR_CHURCH_OF_DAGON_RATIONALE: "Church of Dagon Rationale"
  STR_CHURCH_OF_DAGON_RATIONALE_UFOPEDIA: "The leading objective of cultists of Dagon is to cause the end of the world as we know it by helping awaken their alien god who will take over the planet and transform it into something else. Why would they do something like this? Well, it turns out that they have a very pessimistic view on reality: according to them, the Universe is full of things too powerful and dangerous for humans to survive on their own. In their eyes, becoming a part of one such power is necessary for our race to survive, and retaining humanity is a luxury we cannot afford.{NEWLINE}Let us hope that they are the ones in the wrong, not us."
  STR_MESSENGERS_OF_DAGON: "Messengers of Dagon"
  STR_MESSENGERS_OF_DAGON_UFOPEDIA: "It appears the Messengers that Cultists of Dagon spoke of are no myth: indeed they come from the sea and are unlikely to be humans. Whoever they are, they possess technology beyond human understanding and are likely a threat to Earth societies, and therefore will be classified as aliens.{NEWLINE}Since now we know what to look for, we will attempt to catch these messengers on land and learn about their origins and motives."
  STR_DAGON: "Dagon"
  STR_DAGON_UFOPEDIA: "Our previous guesses and grim predictions are now confirmed: Dagon is indeed a very powerful and ancient alien being, reigning over a humongous undersea base full of inhuman intelligences. Although this Dagon is currently in a state of 'dreaming', which refers to some sort of psionic hibernation, the eyes of his fortress are set upon humanity. They consider us a lesser race, at best fit for exploitation, at worst to be wiped off the planet.{NEWLINE}The city is still decades away from full combat readiness, but it is certainly an enemy that can prove very difficult to overcome. For now, Dagon's messengers must be stopped at every opportunity."
  STR_UNDERWATER_OPERATIONS: "Underwater Operations"
  STR_UNDERWATER_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "X-Com has the capacity to conduct undersea missions if necessary. When such a mission occurs, you can get to the scene using your standard transport.

We should learn more about them, preferably by arresting their members and interrogating them. This should give us a better understanding of this social phenomenon and help us put a stop to it.{NEWLINE}The second problem, perhaps a more striking one, is a dramatic increase in reports regarding strange creatures, monsters and the like.

Firstly, we will need a proper Chief Researcher, preferably with a background in both biochemistry and exotic physics. Secondly, since we are clearly dealing with some extraterrestrial intelligence, we need a professional Xenologist to uncover all their secrets. Then we need to tighten our cooperation with military circles to secure access to modern weaponry. And finally, we need a Chief Engineer to work on any artifacts we find. Unfortunately we can't just kidnap them, they must come to us by themselves.

The most striking examples include abnormal biological organisms (see attachment no. 2), but we believe that the greatest concern to the UN is the emergence of clandestine terrorist organizations that seem to be somehow related to this paranormal activity. We strongly recommend that the United Nations Committee takes additional steps to gather more intelligence regarding these groups."

  STR_MILESTONE_2_UFOPEDIA: "From: X-Com: Paranormal Activity Unit{NEWLINE}To: United Nations Committee{NEWLINE}Subject: UFO: Enemy Unknown{NEWLINE}Our investigation into the matter of recent paranormal activity has given us solid proof that the 'cults' are related to some kind of an extraterrestrial force, which actively supports these organizations. The same extraterrestrial force seems to be behind unusual biological phenomena encountered on Earth that we were able to examine in detail. We are not yet aware of the aliens' objectives or modus operandi, but their activity appears to be coordinated and global. Considering that this activity seems to promote disorder and danger to human life, we are suggesting that the aliens should be regarded as hostile to humanity for the time being, and that greater means are necessary to gather more information regarding this threat."

Moreover, we are threatened not by just one force, but a number of possible competitors: the mysterious aliens from the skies, the undersea civilization of the Deep Ones, an unknown world beneath the surface of the Earth and finally the human collaborators. We estimate that none of them are ready for a full-on invasion yet, but they will do what they can to weaken and confuse us.{NEWLINE}Therefore I strongly recommend a more focused approach to building up Earth's defenses, starting with giving X-Com full military rights to intervene on behalf of not just the UN, but all of humanity."

Although unable to speak, they are capable of communication with humans using technology. Spider Kings dwell deep underground, commanding their arachnid armies via psychic links with Spider Queens. Interestingly, they consider Queens their equals, not subordinates. Spider Kings are psionics, and their humanoid brains allow them to affect humans.

Its only flaw is that it cannot successfully reproduce, but it may be that there is some sort of a 'queen' version of the Chupacabra species which breeds these hunters. It is recommended to engage these creatures at long range if at all possible."

  STR_CHUPACABRA_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This organism is clearly alien in origin, possessing many features unknown on Earth. It has an exoskeleton like our invertebrates, but its neural and cardiovascular structures are more analogous to large mammals in their complexity.

  STR_DARKSTAR_UFOPEDIA: "Use of alien technology and ultralight tritanium allowed us to develop an unmanned aircraft with previously unreachable uptime. The radar has been configured for better detection of UFOs.{NEWLINE}WPN: BEAM x 1{NEWLINE}SYS: ELEC x 3"
  STR_ALIEN_TURRET: "Alien Turret"
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_TURRET_ARMOR: "Alien Laser Turret Analysis"

  STR_ALIEN_LASER_TURRET_CORPSE: "Wrecked Alien Laser Turret"
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_TURRET_AUTOPSY: "Wrecked Alien Laser Examination"
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_TURRET_UFOPEDIA: "This stationary turret is armed with a powerful laser cannon, protected with a powerful Gold shield and coordinated with Alien Electronics. The aliens use them to protect their major facilities."
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_TURRET_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA: "This turret is protected by sturdy Tritanium armor. Its chassis holds a powerful laser weapon and two shield generators. There is no power source, as the turret relies of external power supply."
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_TURRET_DISASSEMBLY: "Alien Laser Turret Disassembly"
  STR_CYBERDISC_WEAPON: "Cyberdisc Cannon"
  STR_CYBERDISC_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "This powerful plasma weapon can easily melt concrete and vaporize life forms."
  STR_CYBERDISC_ARMOR: "Cyberdisc Combat Analysis"
  STR_CYBERDISC_CORPSE: "Wrecked Cyberdisc"
  STR_SECTOPOD_ARMOR: "Sectopod Combat Analysis"
  STR_SECTOPOD_CORPSE: "Wrecked Sectopod"
  STR_SECTOPOD_UFOPEDIA: "Sectopods are robotic creatures armed with a powerful laser beam. These mechanical beasts are typically controlled via a telepathic link, usually by the Ethereals. Sectopods are probably the most powerful terror weapon available to the alien forces."
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY: "Sectopod Autopsy"
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The robot is sturdily constructed with powered armor capable of resisting most forms of attack, in particular plasma weapons. However, the sensing circuitry seems particularly vulnerable to laser weapons."
  STR_CYBERDISC_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature flying saucer is an automated terror weapon armed with a powerful plasma beam. The anti-gravity propulsion gives it a big advantage in difficult terrain. Its primary function is destruction and terror in the service of the Sectoid race."
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY: "Cyberdisc Autopsy"
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Cyberdisc is well shielded and is particularly good at withstanding explosive ammunition. The primary anti-gravity system is too badly damaged to gain any understanding of its functioning."

  STR_TANKS_DESTROYED: "SUPPORT UNITS DESTROYED"
  STR_ALIEN_DIPLOMACY: "Alien Diplomacy"
  STR_ALIEN_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA: "It appears that this is not the first time the aliens came upon our world - apparently, before humans even came to be, a large alien ship crashed on Earth. Now the current invaders are still looking for their lost ancestors in hope of reestablishing contact. The aliens are convinced that the ancient crew, or their descendants, are still alive on Earth, though we do not know why. If the two forces ever meet and turn on us together, it will be a dark day for humanity indeed."
  STR_ENVOY_SHIP: "Envoy ship"
  STR_ENVOY_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "Envoy Ships are extremely rare on Earth, carrying members of the Ethereal Order to communicate with other star-spanning forces. They are not dedicated warships, but should not be underestimated. Since they usually carry valuable aliens on board, we should attempt to seize them at all costs. They can be easily identified by a gold hue."
  STR_SECTOID_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: "The Sectoid Guard is an organization of Sectoid individuals that are separated from the normal Sectoid chain of command and trained by the Ethereals themselves. These guardians then are tasked with high-priority missions, like protecting key installations, and are issued body armor for increased protection. They sometimes travel with regular Sectoids as advisors, but otherwise rarely interact with other aliens, except Ethereals. We can expect to see more of them when we get near the aliens' command structure."
  STR_ETHEREAL_ORDER: "Ethereal Order"
  STR_ETHEREAL_ORDER_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Order is the innermost circle of the alien society. Composed solely of Ethereals, this group seems to stand above all specimens we normally encounter on Earth. They also seem to have access to technology that isn't available, or even understandable, to the 'common' aliens. It is unclear whether they are the rulemakers for the aliens or simply an executive organ. Powerful as they may be, they do not take direct part in the invasion effort."
  STR_SPECTRAL_SCYTHE: "Spectral Scythe"
  STR_SPECTRAL_SCYTHE_UFOPEDIA: "This arcane alien weapon utilizes psionic fields in unspeakable ways, resulting in immensely destructive melee attacks. It is capable of ignoring almost any grade of armor. We are unable to comprehend, much less reproduce this device."
  STR_PHOTON_SPEAR: "Photonic Spear"
  STR_PHOTON_SPEAR_UFOPEDIA: "This melee weapon employs photonic energy to create a short 'blade' made of pure energy, extending from the shaft. The weapon is powered with an exotic energy source unlike anything the aliens normally use. We are unable to understand this process to any degree sufficient for its analysis, much less reproduction."
  STR_PHOTON_BLADE: "Photonic Blade"
  STR_PHOTON_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "This melee weapon uses exotic physics to create a narrow beam of focused photonic energy with limited length. Particles travel from the hilt to the tip of the 'blade' and then inexplicably return, losing very little energy in the process. There seems to be some sort of energy source built into the hilt of the weapon, but we failed to understand its principles of operation and therefore are unable to reproduce this weapon. It is also inconsistent with other artifacts of alien technology.{NEWLINE}>Concealable"
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_LAUNCHER: "Blaster Multi-Launcher"
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon seems to be a miniaturized version of the dreaded Blaster Launcher. Its principles of operation are similar, but it uses far more advanced psionic circuitry. This psionic circuitry allows for firing multiple missiles almost in rapid succession. Instead of one big chamber for the Blaster Bomb, it has a magazine socket."
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_BOMB: "Blaster Multi-Bomb"
  STR_BLASTER_MULTI_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "This magazine contains eight high-powered mini-missiles for the Blaster Multi-Launcher. While not as powerful as the Blaster Bomb, these missiles are devastating nonetheless and can be fired rapidly."
  STR_FIRE_LAUNCHER: "Fire Launcher"
  STR_FIRE_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This heavy weapon fires orbs of concentrated energy that explode on impact. Its most significant property is that we couldn't find a power source of any kind, nor could we form any coherent theory on how this launcher operates at all. This weapon is far too exotic to be manufactured in our workshops."
  STR_ELECTRO_WHIP: "Neural Whip"
  STR_ELECTRO_WHIP_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon is essentially similar in function to the Stun Rod, but that doesn't even begin to describe its unusual properties. The whip uses modulated electric impulses to incapacitate the target, but we do not really understand how this modulation works or even where the energy comes from. While we now know how to use this weapon, we are unable to reproduce it.{NEWLINE}>Concealable"

  STR_MASS_DRIVER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Inspired by Gauss weapons (though not as advanced), mass drivers feature a powerful coil which propels small projectiles using electromagnetic force. Mass driver bullets are much faster than traditional bullets, and therefore much more powerful, but also have a rather short range, since they quickly burn up in the atmosphere. Due to the extreme heat produced by mass driver weapons they are incapable of automatic fire."

The organs have a diffuse quality, all the apparatus are spread within the mass of entrails.

  STR_ALIEN_DOMINATION_UFOPEDIA: "As the war drags on, the aliens will introduce new powerful technology and elite troops to scare Earth governments into submission. Such displays of military might are very dangerous to X-Com, both indirectly (as the governments are likely to get quite nervous) and directly (since the aliens have no qualms about attacking X-Com craft whenever possible). We should do what we can to stop them, despite the enormous risk."
  STR_ALIEN_RESEARCH_EARLY: "Alien Research"
  STR_ALIEN_RESEARCH: "Alien Research"
  STR_ALIEN_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The alien research mission is used for collecting basic data on Earth and its inhabitants.

  STR_ALIEN_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "Once an alien base is constructed it is then resupplied on a regular basis by a special supply vessel. If one of these vessels is detected while landing then it is certain that an alien base is nearby."
  STR_ALIEN_ABDUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "This is a most insidious form of alien activity. The abduction by aliens is widely reported, despite the aliens' attempts to erase the experience from their victims' memories. Abductees report being subject to humiliating physical examinations, including impregnation of human women with alien fetuses and bizarre genetic experiments. The purpose behind this activity appears to be linked to genetic mutation and manipulation of the aliens' own genetic material. This activity causes great alarm, and occurs in populated areas or cities."
  STR_ALIEN_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens have many uses for earth's fauna. Animals are abducted secretly and returned with various organs removed. Cattle mutilations are predominantly reported along with UFO sightings. This type of alien activity causes great concern for governments and considerable anxiety amongst the population. This type of activity occurs mainly in farming land. The theory behind the 'alien harvest' suggests that alien races originally 'seeded' the planet with its flora and fauna, and now they have returned to reap the harvest they have sown."
  STR_ALIEN_TERROR_UFOPEDIA: "When the aliens terrorize a city, they will deploy some special forces equipped for mass slaughter, including biological weapons. Civilians will be directly threatened and governments will be forced to evacuate whole areas. The main purpose behind this activity is to generate sufficient public hysteria so that governments will threaten the X-Com project."
  STR_ALIEN_BASE_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens will construct secret underground bases in remote locations. After some initial reconnaissance flights some intense UFO activity will occur as the base is being built. These bases are known to contain experimental labs for human abductees and supplies for further activity in the region. The presence of alien bases will generate a large amount of reported alien activity without the presence of UFOs. In order to locate a base an X-Com craft must patrol an area for a few hours to stand some chance of detection."
  STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA: "If X-Com interceptors are being particularly successful in shooting down UFOs then the aliens may take some retaliatory action. This could result in a direct attack against an X-Com base. However, the aliens have to find an X-Com base in order to attack it, and provided UFOs are kept away then there should be little danger of an assault."
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA: "Earth governments can be infiltrated by alien agents which are human in appearance. This can result in official contact between aliens and governments at the highest level. The climax of this activity is characterized by intense UFO activity in the vicinity of major cities. The aliens will attempt to sign a pact with an earth government by offering knowledge of their superior technology. In return the government will allow the aliens to conduct their activity unhindered. This alien mission represents the highest level threat to X-Com. If a government agrees to a pact then its funding will cease."

They prefer to live in underground compounds and would be harmed by sunlight, if not for their ocular implants. Their intelligence is average, but they are more than capable of waging a war against mankind."
  STR_CHTONITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This alien has a strong and resilient body, but is otherwise quite similar to us. Its thick skin gives it good protection against bullets and blades alike.

  STR_CHASER_UFOPEDIA: "The Chaser is a light assault cybernetic unit, built for speed and agility. It has simple but effective psychology, built upon fight-or-flight instincts. It is quite resistant to bullets, but can be stopped with fire or explosions. Its short tail provides a counterbalance, useful for sprinting."
  STR_CHASER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is actually a cyborg with sturdy robotic legs. The body is protected by a fine layer of mail, but the biological tissues are pretty vulnerable to damage. Biological components of the body only provide the essential functions, with no digestive system to speak of. The brain is rather well developed and shows all typical features of a predator."

  STR_GAZER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The single big eye is the most prominent anatomical feature of this alien. It has crustacean traits but it is much more evolved. The very thick armor is not simply worn; cybernetic implants stem from it and connect to the organs of the creature."

It could be that they were developed specifically to fight plasma-equipped enemies. The mechanism runs too hot and radioactive to be applied to human armor."
  STR_HOLODRONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A very complex automaton powered by a massive, for its size, Elerium core. Two shafts stretch from this core and are used to spread the plasma bubble that envelops the creature.

  STR_CYBERMITE_AUTOPSY: "Cybermite Examination"
  STR_WASPITE_UFOPEDIA: "Waspites are elite terror agents and combatants. They are very aggressive, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced, making them fearsome enemies. Their overall frailty though hints to an artillery role, rather than infantry. The spiral device that replaces their original bodies generates an anti-gravity field, enabling them to float through the air."
  STR_WASPITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The anatomy of this creature verges on insanity. The body consists of a spiral life support system, combined with a symbiotic, bioengineered plant. Grafted on to the body are a pair of mechanical arms and the insect-like head of the creature, which is presumably the only piece left of the original species. The plant portion of the body is vulnerable to fire."
  STR_CYBERMITE_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature robot is an automated terror weapon and represents the pinnacle of the alien robotics. As soon as the powerful optical sensor spots a target, the creature runs to it and attacks. The miniaturized Elerium core is set to ignite and explode once damaged enough, making the act of killing the creature deadly for anyone nearby."
  STR_CYBERMITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The most prominent feature of this incredibly complex robot is its weapon, an alloy sting linked to a miniaturized tank which, from the traces found, is presumably filled with a potent toxin. The power core is too damaged to be fully understood but it seems to be designed to be very susceptible to damage and it is likely this will cause it to explode."

  STR_CROC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This humanoid reptilian has thick scales and well-developed muscles. Its tissues seem highly resistant to heat, which suggests that they are best suited for a much hotter environment than present Earth. Its genetic structure looks perfectly terrestrial, though."

  STR_REPTOID_UFOPEDIA: "Reptoids have been on Earth for quite a while. They were here long before the invasion began. They possess extraordinary intelligence, which makes them excellent spies and field agents. There is not much we can say about their origins, but their long history on Earth and their genetic closeness to ourselves point to a terrestrial genesis."
  STR_REPTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is covered with tough scales, able to withstand small caliber bullets with ease. Curiously, despite its reptilian appearance, it seems to be quite resistant to heat. The brain is highly developed, suggesting a possible superhuman intelligence. Its most interesting feature however is the DNA, which is either terrestrial in origin or modeled after Earth creatures."
  STR_SALAMANDRON_UFOPEDIA: "The Salamandron is a frightening beast, vaguely resembling ancient predators but also quite different. Designed solely for terror, it is equipped with incendiary rockets, able to lay waste to a small town within minutes. Its behavior can be regulated by a set of small receivers implanted into its brain, but it largely operates on its own, making it difficult to control but also virtually invulnerable to jamming."
  STR_SALAMANDRON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is very sturdy. It is covered with thick scales that are extremely resistant to heat, but not so much to laser cutters. Its tiny brain features a number of small implants whose purpose seems to be provoking basic 'fight or flight' reactions within its system."

  STR_ALIEN_POWER_SYSTEMS: "Alien Power Systems"
  STR_ALIEN_POWER_SYSTEMS_DEP_1: "Alien Power Systems Prerequisite"
  STR_ALIEN_BIOCHEMISTRY: "Alien Biochemistry"
  STR_ALIEN_BIOCHEMISTRY_UFOPEDIA: "The analysis of alien tissue has confirmed what the biochemists have been suspecting for decades: that varying origins result in varying biochemistries. There are three main biochemistries among the alien races we are facing, with each race having its own specifics. They are all based around organic chemistry, but applied in drastically different ways than ours. The aliens seem to rely more on the usage of transition metals and beryllium in their biological compounds than we do, suggesting they were more readily available during the alien biogenesis - if it was indeed spontaneous. Interestingly, their biochemistry seems to be adapted to the very same temperature range as ours.{NEWLINE}These discoveries reach further than just satisfying our scientific curiosity. With this knowledge we can create more efficient weapons and develop new, chemical methods to deter the aliens."
  STR_ALIEN_CODES: "Alien Codes"
  STR_ALIEN_CODES_UFOPEDIA: "For interplanetary communication, the aliens use special equipment that seems to be able to emit waves which travel faster than the speed of light. These waves are modulated to encode messages with a complex, yet logical pattern. This pattern is now understood by us, which gives us hope of attaining the possibility of intercepting and decoding alien communications."
  STR_ALIEN_OPTICAL_PROCESSOR: "Alien Optical Processor"
  STR_ALIEN_OPTICAL_PROCESSOR_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens use a special device to communicate with their navigation equipment. This device emits carefully modulated flashes of bright light directly into the eyes of the operator, stimulating their brain and therefore feeding them with information. It is unclear how this device receives feedback from the pilot, but it seems to read and analyze their brain wave patterns, which are then processed and fed into the UFO Navigation."
  STR_HYPERWAVES: "Hyperwaves"
  STR_HYPERWAVES_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens can convert energy into exotic waves which travel through a medium that can only be described as 'hyperspace'. They are in fact tachyons, which technically travel back in time, but some unknown laws of physics prevent them from causing a temporal paradox and destroying causality. These waves allow for instantaneous two-way communication over large distances, including interstellar."
  STR_ALIEN_ASTROMETRICS: "Alien Astrometrics"
  STR_ALIEN_ASTROMETRICS_UFOPEDIA: "Even to the aliens, deep space navigation is a significant challenge, considering they require very exotic physics which makes hyperwave theory look trivial in comparison. Advanced space navigation requires a highly trained helmsman who psionically interfaces with the ship's systems to gain multi-dimensional perception of spacetime. While we cannot fully grasp this technology yet, we can use it to improve our space travel capabilities and significantly shorten interplanetary flights."
  STR_ALIEN_ELECTRONICS: "Alien Electronics"
  STR_ALIEN_ELECTRONICS_UFOPEDIA: "Instead of integrated microprocessors, the aliens use specially grown crystal matrices to create logic machines. While not inherently faster, these crystals allow for multi-threaded communication between its nodes, thereby achieving and even surpassing the level of the theoretical quantum computer. Now we have a rough understanding of how these alien 'electronics' work and even how to program them, but sadly we do not possess the technology to make them from scratch - we need to rely on whatever we can gather on the battlefield.{NEWLINE}>Concealable"
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS: "Plasma Weapons"
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Now that we have a solid scientific foundation of the physics involved in the aliens' plasma weaponry, we are able to replicate their designs. In theory we could develop our own plasma-based weapons from scratch, but this would be a costly, time intensive and potentially dangerous affair. Reports from the field suggest that the aliens have already settled on a well rounded arsenal, so it is much more practical for us to reverse engineer their existing weaponry.{NEWLINE}We will be able to reproduce any plasma weapon recovered from the field as soon as we have studied it."
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS: "Fusion Weapons"
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Humanity's command over nuclear fusion has historically been crude to say the least, but with the knowledge we've gleaned from the aliens we are now capable of using fusion power at much smaller scales and with a much greater degree of control.{NEWLINE}We are now capable of producing any fusion powered weapon in our workshop, so long as we have a workable design for it."
  STR_FUSION_EXPLOSIVES: "Fusion Explosives"
  STR_FUSION_EXPLOSIVES_UFOPEDIA: "While the Elerium element in itself is extremely efficient at releasing large amounts of energy at once, it can also be used to initiate a fusion reaction. While not as efficient, a fusion blast is far cheaper and easier to create. Combined in the right proportion with a highly energetic crystalline material, this allows for violent discharges of energy, emitting large amounts of heat but very little radiation. This discovery can potentially revolutionize human warfare against the aliens."
  STR_DELTA_RADIATION: "Delta Radiation"
  STR_DELTA_RADIATION_UFOPEDIA: "Delta rays are completely different from any other sort of radiation known to humanity. These rays generally do not interact with ordinary matter or energy, so they are harmless to humans and impossible to detect with ordinary equipment. They do, however, react with the Elerium element, exciting its atoms and destabilizing their structure, therefore allowing for quick conversion from matter to energy. This is possible thanks to the unique structure of the E-115 molecule, which allows it to trap Delta Radiation. Unfortunately, the right frequency to provoke this reaction makes their range extremely short, which prevents us from disrupting alien weaponry on the battlefield."
  STR_UFO_PROPULSION: "UFO Propulsion"
  STR_UFO_PROPULSION_UFOPEDIA: "The propulsion system of UFOs is very unlike what most people associate with this term. There are no exhausts, no pistons, no propellers of any discernible kind. However this appears baffling only till you realize how alien technologies relate to one another. Tritanium can be easily forged into any kind of power conduit. The puzzling patterns on the surface and inside a UFO hull actually do serve a purpose: they conduct and resonate with electromagnetic and gravitic waves that are fed into them directly through a Power Source's base, which rests on a Tritanium floor. This turns the whole UFO hull into one giant propeller, its 'thrust' directed by minute changes in the state of the gravitic-magnetic field, which are in turn precisely adjusted by extremely efficient Optronic circuitry. This also explains why UFOs go down even when our weaponry hasn't managed to seriously dent the hull. The feedback effect causes their power sources to fail."
  STR_PARTICLE_MICROACCELERATION: "Particle Microacceleration"
  STR_PARTICLE_MICROACCELERATION_UFOPEDIA: "Many alien designs, including plasma weapons, feature a particle acceleration chamber. Based on gravity modulation, this component accelerates small lumps of matter to whirl at great velocities, creating enough heat to produce plasma. This process is very fast, therefore it requires E-115 to provide the necessary amount of energy."
  STR_ANTIMATTER_CONTAINMENT: "Anti-Matter Containment"
  STR_ANTIMATTER_CONTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Anti-matter is an excellent source of energy, but this also makes it extremely unstable. The aliens have overcome this problem by a clever application of gravity fields, separating the anti-matter from normal matter and thus preventing them from reacting with each other, as long as the field is in place. This discovery is likely to bring great advancement to human civilization, and certainly can be used against the alien threat."
  STR_ALIEN_GRAVITY_GENERATOR: "Alien Gravity Generator"
  STR_ALIEN_GRAVITY_GENERATOR_UFOPEDIA: "The Alien Gravity Generator is in fact a graviton emitter, which can amplify, nullify or modulate gravity fields on small scales. While it has no direct combat application, it is sure to be a great boon to human space exploration, atmospheric flight and many fields of engineering."
  STR_TRACTOR_BEAM_GENERATOR: "Tractor Beam Generator"
  STR_TRACTOR_BEAM_GENERATOR_UFOPEDIA: "This large-scale device is used in Alien Bases to assist large UFOs with precise landing. It employs artificial gravity to decrease and otherwise manipulate the mass of large objects up to 400 meters away. It is, however, far too bulky to be mounted on any flying craft, even the largest UFOs, and therefore provides no advantage to our troops."
  STR_ADVANCED_PLASMA_PHYSICS: "Advanced Plasma Physics"
  STR_ADVANCED_PLASMA_PHYSICS_UFOPEDIA: "While plasma has been known to human science for decades, it remained highly unpredictable and difficult to produce in a controlled environment. Alien science seems to have overcome these obstacles centuries ago, thanks to some dedicated mathematical equations and technological advancements derived from them. With time, we will be able to understand and copy this equipment for our own energy needs."
  STR_ALIEN_BIOLOGY: "Alien Biology"
  STR_ALIEN_BIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "Our preliminary research show that aliens have DNA much like ours, but so different that we should assume it has extraterrestrial origins - or at least coming from some inconceivable depths of time. Moreover, certain fragments seem to have been added artificially, probably extracted from Earth organisms. This likely helps the aliens to adapt to our environment, but it is either short-term or incomplete: dependent on pre-processed nutrients and with poor immunology, aliens can't survive on Earth for long, therefore special arrangements must be made to study a living specimen."
  STR_ALIEN_SUBJUGATION: "Alien Subjugation"
  STR_ALIEN_SUBJUGATION_UFOPEDIA: "While humans use electrical impulses to cause a neural system to overload, the aliens have developed a much more efficient and safer method, based on gravitic distortion. A gravity wave of a fine-tuned frequency disrupts higher brain functions within a fraction of a second, while leaving other bodily functions unharmed. This method is extremely effective in temporarily disabling humans, be it on the battlefield or in alien surgery rooms."
  STR_ALIEN_NEUROPSYCHOLOGY: "Alien Neuropsychology"
  STR_ALIEN_NEUROPSYCHOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "While there are many types of alien life forms, they do share certain neuropsychological features that are either inherent to their species or artificially inserted. These features allow the aliens to cooperate in a hive-like manner, despite biological differences. These common patterns are mostly related to non-verbal communication, internal visualization and transmission of simple emotions. Now we can expect to be able to tap into their interpersonal communication channels and possibly use it to our advantage."
  STR_ALIEN_NARRATIVE: "Alien Narrative"
  STR_ALIEN_NARRATIVE_UFOPEDIA: "While the alien language allows us to communicate simple concepts, it took us a long time to grasp the whole context of the alien culture. Now we understand the framework of their social narrative, which allows us to learn about more abstract aspects of their life, their interests, fears or ideals. We can now understand alien stories, retelling and explaining the Universe.{NEWLINE}I cannot emphasize enough how vital this is for our research: after all, knowing your enemy is half the victory."
  STR_ALIEN_GARDENS: "Alien Gardens"
  STR_ALIEN_GARDENS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien Bases contain special facilities for the cultivation of genetically engineered plant-like life forms. Despite their name, these 'gardens' play little part in alien food production; instead they produce various biochemicals used in alien industry and warfare."
  STR_ALIEN_POWER_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien technology routinely uses incredibly advanced components that store, release and transmit high energies easily, safely and with minimal losses. Although completely different in design from our own equipment, and using unusual materials, they can now be copied relatively easily by our engineers and used for a variety of applications."
  STR_ALLOY_AMMO: "Tritanium Ammunition"
  STR_ALLOY_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "With the knowledge of how to process the ultra-strong yet lightweight Alien Alloys, we can now manufacture tritanium bullets capable of withstanding higher muzzle velocities without disintegrating, fired from alloy casings that are lighter yet stronger than previously possible."
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_CALIBRATION: "Fusion Weapons Calibration"
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_CALIBRATION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien fusion weapons are extremely potent, but they must be recalibrated daily to stay usable. Since we have learned how to do so, we can employ such alien weapons from now on, provided that we manage to secure them on the battlefield."
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_CALIBRATION: "Plasma Weapons Calibration"
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_CALIBRATION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien plasma weapon clips must be recalibrated daily to stay usable. Since we have learned how to do so, we can employ such alien weapons from now on, provided that we manage to secure them on the battlefield.{NEWLINE}Our initial tests show that these weapons easily melt armor with their intense heat and can cause anything they hit to burst into flame. They inflict great damage more often than not."
  STR_UFO_SUBTYPES: "UFO Subtypes"
  STR_UFO_SUBTYPES_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens can produce unique parts with ease equal to mass production. Therefore, even though their ships are inorganic, most UFOs are built to be different within certain parameters. They are designed using a process that parallels mutation in living organisms. This means that while all ships of any given type are similar to one another, they may differ wildly in internal details like the floor plan. There are even 'strains', or subtypes of UFOs which share major characteristics."
  STR_ALIEN_VOCABULARY: "Alien Vocabulary"
  STR_ALIEN_VOCABULARY_UFOPEDIA: "Despite having the general understanding of alien grammar and syntax, our biological and cultural differences made it very difficult to create a comprehensive lexicon of precise, technical terms. Now we have collected enough knowledge to finally get a clear picture of the alien science, which allows us to move on with understanding their technology.{NEWLINE}From now on, we will have a much better idea on what questions to ask when dealing with alien specialists and how to interpret their answers."
  STR_ALIEN_PROGRAMMING: "Alien Programming"
  STR_ALIEN_PROGRAMMING_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens have an organic approach to coding, since their computers resemble biological brains rather than our circuitry: not only they are heavily interconnected, but also fractal, which means that every alien device is unique to a certain degree. Therefore, their software must be capable of running on such sophisticated machines with no compatibility issues. This is achieved using polymorphic algorithms, which adapt to any device they are uploaded to and function as a gate between the hardware and the actual program. Such algorithms are also used to test newly produced electronics to ensure compatibility."
  STR_ALIEN_WAVE_FIELD_THEORY: "Alien Wave-Field Theory"
  STR_ALIEN_WAVE_FIELD_THEORY_UFOPEDIA: "Alien physics reveals a whole new world of exotic forces, particles and dimensions, some of which we have already predicted theoretically, but most of them we have never even thought of before. The alien model not only allows us to understand things we used to struggle with, like singularities or the nature of time, but also is sure to bring many technological advancements in the near future. While complex and difficult, this model is perfectly logical and seems to reflect our reality flawlessly."
  STR_ALIEN_CHEMISTRY: "Alien Chemistry"
  STR_ALIEN_CHEMISTRY_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens have extensive knowledge of both exotic and ordinary matter, clearly beyond what humanity has achieved. Their material engineering mostly revolves around crystalline forms, blending inorganic and biological manufacturing processes to create materials with fantastic properties: ultra-durable alloys, hyperactive chemicals, intelligent biological compounds. The aliens also excel at medicine, utilizing advanced chemistry to flawlessly merge cybernetics with living flesh."
  STR_FUSION_TORCH: "Fusion Torch"
  STR_FUSION_TORCH_POWER_CELL: "Fusion Torch Power Cell"
  STR_FUSION_TORCH_UFOPEDIA: "The Fusion Torch uses a Matter-Antimatter reaction to create enormously powerful plasma jets.{NEWLINE}If close enough, the deeply penetrating plasma jet cuts through the target, melting it within seconds. Even the strongest armor plates and UFO hulls are no match for this device.{NEWLINE}However, it is only effective at close range and needs a separate power cell."
  STR_ELERIUM_MACE: "Power Mace"
  STR_ELERIUM_MACE_UFOPEDIA: "Using Elerium-115 as fuel, this power weapon discharges a powerful electrical pulse to its unfortunate victim. A successful strike will overload the nervous system of the target, effectively incapacitating it. The Power Mace will stun organic beings."

  STR_CHEMICAL_FLARE: "Chemical Flare"
  STR_CHEMICAL_FLARE_UFOPEDIA: "This compact device produces a bright flare of light at any depth using chemical reaction with water. For efficient use, it needs to be filled with reagent an hour before use, and then primed by destroying the membrane to make it glow brightly. It cannot be reused after filling with the mixture, so it will become unusable after the mission in any case, even if it has not been primed.{NEWLINE}Using the flare in other than water will destroy it immediately due to overheating."
  STR_AMPHIBIOUS_WEAPONS: "Amphibious Weapons"
  STR_AMPHIBIOUS_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Underwater operations could be a lot more dangerous than we expected. From the very beginning, I have been looking for a solution to the issue of providing our agents with decent long-range weapons. Recently, I have been able to establish good contacts with some representatives of Russian special forces; thanks to our recent promotion by the Council, they agreed to supply us with amphibious weapons, which prove to be very useful for combat divers."
