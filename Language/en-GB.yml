  STR_MEDAL_GLOBETROTTER_NAME: "Globetrotter"
  STR_MUTON_SHADER: "Muton Shader"
  STR_MUTON_SHADER_UFOPEDIA: "These female Mutons have developed brain structures which grant them a psionic cloaking effect. They are also even faster and nimbler, though with a slightly lower muscle mass. These rare units are used for recon and support in major alien operations behind the enemy lines."
  STR_DEATH_DISC: "Death Disc"
  STR_DEATH_DISC_UFOPEDIA: "This throwing weapon is assisted with a micrograv engine, which keeps it spinning in the air. After the disc strikes its target, it automatically returns to the user. Its monomolecular edge makes it a terrifying weapon, able to penetrate even advanced armour."
  STR_ADVENT_MEDIUM_GROUND_CONVOY: "Hybrid Medium Convoy"
  STR_THE_THING_POLARNIK: "Civilian"
  STR_THE_THING_DOG_CORPSE: "Dead Dog"

These agents will partake in tactical combat normally.{NEWLINE}You may manually select which agent will pilot the vehicle from the Pilots menu in the craft equip screen. If you don't assign a Pilot, whichever Agent is lowest on the Crew list will automatically be assigned as the Pilot.{NEWLINE}In combat with UFOs, the Pilot's stats have the following effects:{NEWLINE}>FIRING ACCURACY affects the chance to hit the UFO.{NEWLINE}>REACTIONS affects the chance to avoid incoming fire.{NEWLINE}>BRAVERY affects how quickly the craft will approach the UFO.{NEWLINE}Pilots can gain experience in these stats (and these stats only) by successfully engaging and defeating UFOs. Note that some craft require more than one Pilot. In such cases, all Pilots' stats will be averaged. All Pilots will earn experience from shooting down UFOs."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_ARMOR: "Hallucinoid Combat Analysis"
  STR_HALLUCINOID_TERRORIST: "Hallucinoid"
  STR_HALLUCINOID: "Hallucinoid"
  STR_HALLUCINOID_UFOPEDIA: "Having harvested the oceans, the aliens have bred these huge Earth creatures as a weapon. Do not be lulled into a false sense of security when facing these harmless looking Sailors of the Deep. Possessing a close combat icy strike and powerful psionic abilities, the Hallucinoid is a deadly foe."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_AUTOPSY: "Hallucinoid Autopsy"
  STR_HALLUCINOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Nested in the many layers of this organisms gelatinous body is a powerful chemical freezer: its main offensive capability. The soft and supple skin of the Hallucinoid seems susceptible to heat based attacks."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_FREEZE: "Hallucinoid Freeze"
  STR_HALLUCINOID_PSI_WEAPON: "Hallucinoid Mental Attack"
  STR_MALE_MARINE_OFFICER: "Marine Officer"
  STR_MARINE_BASE_DEFENSE: "MARINE BASE DEFENSE"
  STR_MARINE_BASE_ATTACKED: "MARINE BASE UNDER ATTACK!"
  STR_MARINE_BASE_DEFENSE_BRIEFING: "A Hydrospace Dynamics base is under attack! We must rush to their defense, as they cannot withstand the alien attack alone. We will not be able to retreat from this mission."
  STR_MARINE_BASE_DEFENSE_DESCRIPTION: "A Hydrospace Dynamics base is under attack! Repel the alien forces. We will not be able to retreat from this mission."
  STR_CALCINITE_ZAPPER: "Calcinite's Electric Attack"
  STR_CALCINITE_ARMOR: "Calcinite Combat Analysis"
  STR_CALCINITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once the armoured suit is stripped away, the Calcinite is revealed to be a huge amorphous blob of protoplasm. No visible brain, limbs or sensory organs exist. A small metallic component resides deep in the liquid body. Once dead we can only guess at the creature's nature. An inexplicable enigma of our alien enemies."
  STR_REPTOID_DRAGONFIRE_TURRET_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This immobile firing platform's core consists of an intricate system of emitters and mirrors, protected by heavy terramite armour. It creates and shoots energy bolts."
  STR_MINOTAUR_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This 300 kg beast is protected by armour plates implanted under large areas of its skin. The skull is very sturdy and resistant. Its horns are covered with a titanium alloy, making them an even more formidable weapon."
  STR_UNARMED_ARMORED_VEST: "Unarmed Attack (Armoured Vest)"
  STR_UNARMED_ARMORED_VEST_H: "Unarmed Attack (Armoured Vest - Hybrid)"
  STR_UNARMED_ARMORED_VEST_SHIELD: "Unarmed Attack (Armoured Vest/Shield)"

  STR_UNARMED_CYBER_ARMOR: "Unarmed Attack (Cyber Armour)"
  STR_UNARMED_CYBER_ARMOR_H: "Unarmed Attack (Cyber Armour - Hybrid)"
  STR_SHOGG_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "This short sword is too heavy for comfortable use by normal humans, but absolutely devastating when wielded by a stronger fighter. Its terramite edge makes it quite effective against armour."
  STR_SHOGG_HAMMER_UFOPEDIA: "This Terramite hammer is a deadly weapon in strong hands. It easily wrecks weak armour and has a strong concussive effect."
  STR_DISRUPTOR_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "This alien rifle emits a beam of exotic particles that bypass armour almost entirely. It is mostly organic, and the biological component has a lifespan directly related to weapon usage. We do not possess the means to reproduce this weapon in our labs. Armour is effectively irrelevant against warp weapons."
  STR_DISRUPTOR_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "This heavy warp weapon is mostly an overgrown exotic life form capable of emitting strange rays that bypass all known forms of armour. The creature feeds on itself to replenish expended energy, so its life span shortens whenever the weapon is used. Replicating this weapon is definitely beyond our capabilities. Armour is effectively irrelevant against warp weapons."
  STR_MRRSHAN_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "This alien pulse rifle shoots metallic projectiles not much different from Earth design. It is, however, much more advanced than any gun we can produce on Earth: light, sturdy and deadly.{NEWLINE}Like all pulse weapons, it causes an additional 25% damage to the target's Health (after armour penetration)."
  STR_FLOATER_LEGIONNAIRE_UFOPEDIA: "This elite Floater warrior is heavily armoured and has even more cybernetic augmentations than the regular type. There are also significant behavioral differences: while common Floaters are brutal and violent, this one is calm and collected, yet far outperforms its 'lesser' brethren in military action. This is in no small part an effect of special brain implants, which suppress its raw emotions almost completely and optimize its behavior for maximum efficiency. It is unclear why this horrifying technology isn't used more commonly by the aliens, but a likely reason is decreased long-term mental stability."
  STR_FLOATER_LEGIONNAIRE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Floater is a huge upgrade over the regular type. All cybernetic implants are more advanced, including the antigravity unit which is stronger and more stable. The Legionnaire has been fitted with very complex cybersenses, giving it perfect battle awareness no matter the conditions, and artificial glands which increase its reflexes. It also wears thick armour, resistant to both standard and energy weapons."
  STR_BADASS_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This humongous Chryssalid is heavily armoured and carries a number of eggs, clearly meant for a host much bigger than a human. We have found chemical traces of several other specimens in the body."
  STR_MALE_CIVILIAN_BLACK: "Civilian"
  STR_MAGNUM: "Magnum"

  STR_STORMLANCE_MISSILE: "Stormlance Missile"
  STR_STORMLANCE_MISSILES: "Stormlance Missiles"
  STR_STORMLANCE_LAUNCHER: "Stormlance Missile Launcher"
  STR_MELEE_UFOPEDIA: "For most fighters, melee weapons are only for desperate situations, but some agents rather enjoy their strong points: power and speed."
  STR_PISTOLS_UFOPEDIA: "Pistols have a number of advantages: they suffer no penalty from one-handed use, are fast-firing, light and easy to carry. Their main problem is limited effective range."
  STR_RIFLES_UFOPEDIA: "Rifles are very accurate, also at long distances. They often have autofire mode. They are highly versatile, the only significant disadvantage being that they require both hands."
  STR_CANNONS_UFOPEDIA: "Cannons are big, bulky weapons that deal high damage. They tend to have decent Aimed Shot accuracy and average Snap Shot accuracy. Some Cannons also have Auto-Shot mode and/or unusual ammo."
  STR_LAUNCHERS_UFOPEDIA: "Rocket launchers shoot self-propelled rockets, usually with an explosive charge. They are slow to use and can be heavy, but they deal massive damage and often have good damage radius."
  STR_MACHINE_GUNS_UFOPEDIA: "Machine Guns are powerful, accurate and have good, long auto-shots. They are quite heavy though and have limited use other than suppressive fire."
  STR_CYBERWEB_BATTERY_UFOPEDIA: "High-powered Cyberweb equipment relies on special batteries that seem to employ some very exotic physics. The battery does not contain any power source; instead it uses some sort of interdimensional suction to procure the energy from another plane, possibly another universe. It is not, however, eternal, as its structure easily crumbles under strain, only allowing for some energy to be transferred before it burns up. On the positive side, the battery is completely invisible to all forms of energy detection, unless it is active. The device seems rather experimental, but is very impressive.{NEWLINE}The same Cyberweb battery can be used to power various weapons and equipment, but each time it must be calibrated for a particular device. Various configurations are colour-coded."
  STR_STAFF_019_UFOPEDIA: "Commander, I know these past weeks were pretty stressful for you. I also know about that last fruitless interrogation, which probably didn't help either. Therefore, as a medical doctor, I recommend these brightly coloured pills of my personal design. Take one after breakfast and one in the evening, they will make you feel much better. Trust me, they are thoroughly tested."
  STR_CORRIDOR: "Corridor"
  STR_OBLITERATOR: "Obliterator"
  STR_OBLITERATOR_AUTOPSY: "Obliterator Autopsy"
  STR_OBLITERATOR_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This automated unit is clearly armed and armored for war. Its triple-layered alloy shielding is primarily designed to withstand energy weapons, but its thickness also renders most kinetic weapons ineffective. Its chamber stores 14 powerful Elerium rockets."
  STR_OBLITERATOR_CORPSE: "Wrecked Obliterator"
  STR_OBLITERATOR_TERRORIST: "Obliterator Terrorist"
  STR_OBLITERATOR_UFOPEDIA: "This levitating machine of war is heavily armored and armed with powerful Elerium-based missiles. It is employed by the alien race of Mutons as a support unit, primarily in their terror attacks against Earth population."
  STR_STAFF_OF_HEART_GRIP_UFOPEDIA: "This staff is made from a gold-coloured material, light and durable. It contains a large green crystal, very beautiful but causing nausea if admired for too long. It focuses psi energy to crush the victim's vital organs, bypassing all armour. However, natural talent is not enough to use it to good effect."
  STR_GOLF_STICK: "Golf Club"
  STR_SKYRAIDER: "SKYRAIDER"
  STR_SKYRAIDER_UFOPEDIA: "This plane can transport up to 10 people with unprecedented speed."

  STR_JUMP_ARMOR: "Jump Armour"
  STR_JUMP_ARMOR_UC: "JUMP ARMOUR"
  STR_JUMP_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Equipped with an anti-gravity device extracted from a dead Floater, this armour grants limited flying capabilities to the X-Com troops. Since the device's lifting power is limited, the armour is not as durable as the Personal Armour, but its enhanced mobility gives X-Com an unprecedented tactical advantage."

  STR_ETHEREAL_ORDER: "Ethereal Order"
  STR_ETHEREAL_ORDER_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Order is the innermost circle of the alien society. Composed solely of Ethereals, this group seems to stand above all specimens we normally encounter on Earth. They also seem to have access to technology that isn't available, or even understandable, to the 'common' aliens. It is unclear whether they are the rulemakers for the aliens or simply an executive organ. Powerful as they may be, they do not take direct part in the invasion effort."

It could be that they were developed specifically to fight plasma-equipped enemies. The mechanism runs too hot and radioactive to be applied to a human armor."
  STR_HOLODRONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A very complex automaton powered by a massive, for its size, Elerium core.

  STR_CYBERMITE_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature robot is an automated terror weapon and represents the pinnacle of the alien robotics. As soon as the powerful optical sensor spots a target, the creature runs to it and attacks. The miniaturized Elerium core is set to ignite and explode once damaged enough, making the act of killing the creature deadly for anyone nearby."
  STR_CYBERMITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The most prominent feature of this incredibly complex robot is its weapon, an alloy sting linked to a miniaturized tank which, from the traces found, is presumably filled with a potent toxin. The power core is too damaged to be fully understood but it seems to be designed to be very susceptible to damage and it is likely this will cause it to explode."
